The Herald LONDON. — England have left bowlers James Anderson and Stuart Broad out of their cricket squad to tour the West Indies In March. Anderson (39) is England’s all-time leading wicket-taker in Tests with 640 dismissals in 169 matches. The 35-year-old Broad is second on that list, having taken 537 wickets in 152 matches. “I want to emphasise this does not mean the end for them as England players,” said Andrew Strauss, the team’s interim managing director. Anderson and Broad both played in the recent Ashes series in Australia which England, who are captained by Joe Root, lost 4-0. In the aftermath of that thrashing, England head coach Chris Silverwood, director of cricket Ashley Giles and assistant coach Graham Thorpe all left their roles. Strauss has temporarily taken over from Giles and he has appointed Paul Collingwood as England’s interim head coach for the West Indies tour.

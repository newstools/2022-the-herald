The Herald Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter TUSKERS responded to the challenge from defending champions Southern Rocks with a batting masterclass in a six-wicket victory that steered them closer to the Logan Cup cricket title at Old Hararians yesterday. National team players Craig Ervine and Brian Chari featured in a massive partnership of 201 runs, unbroken for the fifth wicket, on a dominant day for the Bulawayo-based side. Tuskers reached the target without losing further wickets on the fourth and final day of the contest having begun the day on 117/4 in pursuit of a target of 288 runs. Ervine’s 123* and Chari’s 110* runs sealed the game for the log leaders who recovered from a first innings deficit to take home the vital 10 points that edged them closer to the domestic first class cricket title. Tuskers were bowled out for 183 runs in their first innings, after Rocks had batted first and put on 245 runs. The Masvingo-based outfit then put on 225 runs for the second innings to set what looked a competitive target. And Tuskers, looked well short having lost four wickets at stumps on the third day. But the experienced duo of Ervine and Chari took them home, with the latter blasting a six off the bowling of Cephas Zhuwao for the final winning runs. Tuskers lead the Logan Cup table with 53 points. Mountaineers, who beat Rhinos by 10 wickets the previous day, are second with 50 points and have a game in hand. Rocks remained third on 30 points. This was Tuskers’ final Logan Cup match, as they have a bye in the final round, which begins this Friday. The vital match will be that between Mountaineers and Rocks, with Mountaineers guaranteed to lift the first-class title if they win or draw. Scorecards:

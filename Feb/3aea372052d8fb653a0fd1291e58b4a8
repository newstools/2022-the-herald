The Herald LONDON. — Kurt Zouma’s cats have been taken away by the RSPCA after a disturbing video emerged of him hitting, dropping, and kicking his pet across his kitchen floor on Monday. The 27-year-old West Ham defender issued an apology but Essex Police confirmed “urgent enquiries” were underway in conjunction with the RSPCA. The RSPCA released a statement on Wednesday saying the cats “are safe and in our care”. “Our priority is and has always been the wellbeing of these cats,” an RSPCA spokesperson said. “They’ve been taken for a check-up at a vets and then will remain in our care while the investigation continues. “We’re grateful to everyone who expressed their concern for these cats. We were dealing with this issue before the video went viral online and are leading the investigation. “We continue to investigate so we cannot comment further at this time.” West Ham condemned Zouma’s actions but the player started the club’s match against Watford on Tuesday night, with manager David Moyes confirming he would remain available for selection while the club’s internal investigation runs its course. The club will back Moyes’ selection decisions and as things stand Zouma is available to play against Leicester on Sunday. It is unlikely Zouma’s actions will lead him to being sacked but the club will deal with him as seriously as possible. — Sky Sports.

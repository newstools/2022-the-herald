The Herald Mashonaland East Bureau A 36-year-old woman from Grasslands, Marondera, was this week allegedly raped by an unknown man in the same area where an AFM pastor was last week raped and killed. The latest victim was raped while she was on her way to collect her children from school. The woman was walking alone on a path which leads to a nearby school on Monday when she noticed that there was a man following her. Upon reaching Sam Lewis Farm gum plantation, it is said the unknown man kept on following her. The man caught up with the woman and demanded her cellphone, which she surrendered. He ordered her to follow him deep into the gum plantation and threatened to kill her if she resisted. The suspect then went on to sexually assaulted the woman. Mashonaland East Province police spokesperson Inspector Simon Chazovachiyi confirmed the incident, and said a manhunt had been launched to bring the suspect to book. “The suspect left the scene, leaving the woman behind, who on the following day proceeded to make a police report,” he said. “We are appealing to members of the public for information which can assist in the arrest of the suspect. We also urge the public, especially women, not to walk alone in bushy areas.” Meanwhile, investigations are in progress following the discovery of the AFM pastor’s body with an axe stuck in her head, in a suspected murder incident. The incident, which left the Grasslands Farm community shell-shocked occurred two weeks ago. It is suspected that the pastor was raped before she was killed. She was discovered half naked, with struggling marks near the scene. Most recently, another woman was allegedly killed in the same bush and there are suspicions that she was also raped before she was hit on the head by a huge stone.

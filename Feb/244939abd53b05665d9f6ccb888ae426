The Herald BERLIN. — Bayern Munich midfielder Joshua Kimmich said his side need to question their mentality after they slumped to a shock 4-2 loss at German Bundesliga football minnows Bochum on Saturday night ahead of Wednesday’s Champions League clash with Red Bull Salzburg. Bayern conceded four goals in the first half for the first time in a Bundesliga match since 1975 as promoted Bochum rampaged to victory, leaving the perennial champions stunned. “This was our worst performance of the season. We need to ask ourselves whether this is the mentality which Bayern Munich embodies,” a dejected Kimmich told Sky. “Luckily it’s happened in a Bundesliga match this time, but we have a Champions League game on Wednesday,” he added. Bayern had not lost to Bochum since 2004 ahead of this game, and beat them 7-0 when the two teams last met in September. — AFP

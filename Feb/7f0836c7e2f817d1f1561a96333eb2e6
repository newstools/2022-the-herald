The Herald CAIRO. — South African football champions Mamelodi Sundowns have broken their away jinx against Al Ahly, defeating the Egyptian giants 1-0 in a CAF Champions League Group A match at the Cairo International Stadium on Saturday night. Thapelo Morena’s late goal secured victory for the Brazilians in a match where they rode their luck but also demonstrated a canny tactical approach and impressive resilience. The result sees the South Africans reclaim top spot on the log with seven points, Al Merrikh are second on four points, while Ahly and Al Hilal have a point apiece. Merrikh and Ahly have played one game less. The first half saw both teams struggling to find a rhythm, with Sundowns generally happy to sit back and crowd out Ahly in defence. The hosts were unable to build up a head of steam until the final 10 minutes or so, spurred on by a near miss from Aliou Dieng who sent an effort just wide from the edge of the penalty area. — AFP

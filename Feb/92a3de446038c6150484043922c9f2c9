The Herald LONDON. — Manchester United will not stand in Cristiano Ronaldo’s way if their Portuguese superstar demands to leave Old Trafford. Ronaldo (37) is believed to be ready to quit the Reds again in the summer if they fail to qualify for the Champions League football. And the Mirror Sport understands that United will allow him to walk out if he makes it clear he wants to go. There is now a growing acceptance inside the club that bringing Ronaldo back after 11 years spent with Real Madrid and Juventus was an error of judgement driven by both commercial factors and the determination to stop him joining rivals Manchester City. Ronaldo was expected to transform the Reds into contenders for the English Premier League and Champions League. Instead, he has become a sideshow. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked and interim manager Ralf Rangnick inherited a squad unable to deliver on his high-energy demands for 90 minutes. — The Mirror

The Herald Bitcoin rose for a fifth consecutive day, the longest winning streak since September, as investors begin to re-embrace risk assets across global markets. The largest cryptocurrency by market value gained as much as 5,8 percent to $44,110. XRP jumped as much as 17 percent to around 78 cents as so-called alt coins rallied more. Shiba Inu led memecoins higher, surging around 50 percent to around 0,000034 cents, according to CoinMarketCap. Global markets have been whipsawed in recent weeks as investors contemplate the prospects of rapid monetary tightening. After reaching a record high of almost US$69 000 in early November, Bitcoin lost as much as 50 percent of its value in what has been called a “crypto winter.” The break above US$43 000 could cause the current up move to target toward the US$45 000 level, according to Nathan Batchelor, lead Bitcoin analyst for SIMETRI Research. “People are starting to feel a little more comfortable dipping their toes back into some of these riskier asset classes after the pullback,” Lindsey Bell, chief markets and money strategist at Ally Financial Inc., said. However, Bell says the market in general isn’t necessarily out of the water yet with lingering uncertainty on multiple fronts, including the speed at which the Federal Reserve and central banks could act to quell rising inflation.  — Bloomberg.

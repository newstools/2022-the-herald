The Herald FLORIDA. — Golf legend Tiger Woods has been packing on the muscle ahead of the Genesis Invitational event this week. The only problem is he’s not playing in the tournament, but will instead host a field that includes the likes of Rory McIlroy and Dustin Johnson. Fifteen-time major winner Woods also hosted the same event last year. But just days later on February 23, 2021, he was involved in a horror crash in Los Angeles that saw him sustain serious leg injuries. It’s kept him out of action ever since, and the tournament this year from February 17-20 will mark almost a year to the day since his life- threatening accident. He did play at the PNC Championship with his son Charlie in December, but is yet to make a return to the PGA tour. Fans though are speculating that Woods might not be far off a comeback after a picture of him looking bulkier than ever was posted online. — The Sun

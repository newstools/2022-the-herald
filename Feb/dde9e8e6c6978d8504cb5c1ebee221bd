The Herald LONDON. — Mikel Arteta believes that Martin Odegaard can be a future Arsenal captain. As Arsenal, inch by inch, have rebuilt their season from that disastrous start, the young Norwegian has been increasingly running the show, armband or not. Goals from Emile Smith Rowe and Bukayo Saka may have won a one-sided game against Brentford for Arsenal at the Emirates on Saturday, and put them within touching distance of fourth place, but it was 23-year-old live-wire Odegaard who was the catalyst. Arsenal had Odegaard for an impressive sixth -on loan spell last year, but he returned to parent club Real Madrid and Arsenal had to battle to make the signing permanent in the summer for £34million. Now, in the No. 10 role in Arteta’s team, Odegaard is a key player. The Arsenal manager said: “Martin has all the qualities to be a captain, absolutely. I have talked to his national team coach Stale Solbakken and they speak highly of him. — The Daily Express

The Herald Singing sensation Rihanna and her rapper partner A$AP Rocky broke the internet yesterday as they shared a post to confirm that they were expecting their first child together. The 33-year-old entertainment and fashion mogul behind the hits “Diamonds” and “Umbrella” strolled hand in hand with boyfriend A$AP Rocky, sporting a long pink jacket buttoned only at the top, paired with a long bejewelled necklace over her bare belly. The images captured just after a blizzard dropped a blanket of snow on New York, in Harlem, where A$AP Rocky grew up, were released and posted on Instagram yesterday by the celebrity photographer Miles Diggs. Rihanna has for years been teasing her legions of fans about a forthcoming album. Her last studio release was in 2016. Since then the Barbadian born Robyn Rihanna Fenty has become a billionaire, parlaying her success in music into successful makeup, lingerie and high fashion brands. Rumours that Rihanna and A$AP Rocky, also 33, were dating swirled for years before the pair confirmed last year that their romance was official. In an interview with GQ magazine published in May 2021 the rapper called Rihanna the “love of my life” and “the One.” Asked in that interview if he was ready to be a father, A$AP Rocky said “I think I’d be an incredible, remarkably, overall amazing dad.” “I would have a very fly child. Very.” – AFP

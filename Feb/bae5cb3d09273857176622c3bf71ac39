The Herald Police in the Midlands province have expressed concern over an increase in cases of vehicle thefts by criminals masquerading as desperate commuters. A number of motorists, the latest a Mhondoro man, have lost their cars to robbers in the province after giving them a lift. “Cases of criminals masquerading as desperate commuters looking for transport are on the increase. There is a high risk of losing property when pirating using private vehicles,” provincial police spokesman Emmanuel Mahoko said. “We reiterate our advise to drivers of private motor vehicles that they should resist the temptation to make money through carrying passengers.” The call comes after a Mhondoro man, Peter Magodhi was recently robbed of his grey Honda Fit (Reg No AFH 2920) valued at US$3 000 in Mbizo 19, Kwekwe. It is alleged that Magodhi had taken the vehicle for repairs at a garage along Fife Avenue in Kwekwe Central Business District. He was, however, directed to a car-breaker in Mbizo 19 to buy a car part. “As he was about to go to the car-breaker, another man requested to accompany him, indicating that he also wanted to buy some car parts, Mahoko said. “The complainant gave the man a lift. Along the way, they were stopped by a woman who he also gave a lift. The woman then requested to be dropped after reaching her destination. ‘‘The driver went out of the vehicle to assist the woman as she disembarked and he left the engine running. “The male passenger who had remained in the motor vehicle jumped to the driver’s seat and drove away, leaving the owner of the motor vehicle and the female passenger at the scene,” said Mahoko. Last month, 26-year- old Cosmas Kangirai of Fairfields in Mvuma lost his vehicle and cash amounting to US$360 after he was robbed by three men and two women who had hired him from Chaka to Chivhu. He lost a white Toyota Runex registration number ADQ 3872. — New Ziana

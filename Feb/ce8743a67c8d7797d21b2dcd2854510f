Speaking from Francistown this morning, the coach told The Herald that it is not going to be easy. “It’s going to be a game that will require a lot of mental fitness in order to deal with the game moments and also if we get everyone at their best because it is more of being able to manage the game demands. “It is not going to be easy considering the result at home but we still need to be focused and mentally strong,” said Sibanda.

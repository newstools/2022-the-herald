The Herald LONDON. — Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain could strike a stunning swap deal in the summer that would see Cristiano Ronaldo move to Paris and Mauricio Pochettino head to Old Trafford. The Red Devils look certain to appoint a new manager in the summer, with Ralf Rangnick not doing enough to be considered for the permanent role during his stint as interim boss so far. Pochettino has long been a target for United and they could move for him at the end of the season, with the potential of Ronaldo going the other way. Paris Saint-Germain are becoming increasingly confident that Ronaldo will leave Manchester United at the end of the season following his frustration at a lack of progress since returning to the English Premier League. That disillusionment intensified on Friday night with United’s exit from the FA Cup leaving Ronaldo with the likelihood that he will end the season without any silverware. PSG are long time admirers of the Portuguese superstar and haven’t been put off by him turning 37 at the weekend. And there is growing support in the PSG boardroom for Ronaldo’s former Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane to replace Pochettino if the ex-Spurs manager fails to land the Champions League. That would play into the hands of Manchester United with Pochettino on the Old Trafford shortlist to become their permanent manager once Ralf Rangnick’s interim period as head coach concludes. — The Mirror.

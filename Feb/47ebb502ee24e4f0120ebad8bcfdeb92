The Herald CENTURION. — As the Genesis Invitational concluded on Sunday, Tiger Woods, as the tournament host, was quizzed about his return to competitive golf — and he simply cannot say when that will happen just yet. Hordes of golf fans would love to see Woods back on the fairways of the PGA Tour as soon as possible, but that’s not realistic anytime soon. The greatest attribute of Woods throughout his 15-major winning career has been his mind, and during his physical peak in his 20s he was simply unstoppable when he was on form. Now, his body is ailing. Not just because he’s 46-years-old, but mainly due to his devastating ankle injury following his car accident on February 23 last year. In November, Woods spoke about the extent of his injuries following the crash, and suggested amputation was a possibility. “I got very lucky, and I am so thankful to all the doctors here that have put the leg back together again because I could have easily lost it. I still have my own limb, so I’m very thankful for that,” said Woods. Not many who hero worship Woods will know of Zimbabwean professional golfer Marc Cayeux. But they should. He too, was in a serious car crash and was close to having his foot amputated. Cayeux, who turned 44 on Tuesday, has some unfortunate injury similarities with Woods. Cayeux is a nine-time winner on the Sunshine Tour and also claimed victory on the European Challenge tour three times. But that was all before, at the age of 32 in September 2010, Cayeux was involved in a horrific car accident that he was lucky to escape alive. Since then, he has had 28 surgeries to his left ankle. — IOL Sport

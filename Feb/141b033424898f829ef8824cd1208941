The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo Senior Arts Reporter Organisers for the 20th edition of the National Arts Merit Award (NAMA) have released the nominees ahead of the show scheduled for February 26 at the Rainbow Towers, Harare. National Arts Council of Zimbabwe director, Nicholas Moyo, said they had since received over 2 135 entries from artistes covering areas such as Binga, Plumtree, Gwanda, Chinhoyi, Mutare, Marondera, Masvingo, Gweru, Ntabazinduna, Bulawayo and Harare. He said the adjudication process was based on submitted entries, as well as those identified by individual and institutional monitors appointed to track excelling artists throughout the nomination period of two years covered by the 20th NAMA. “This means that the nominees to be announced today (yesterday) are for works that were produced from 1 December 2019 to 30 November, 2021,” said Moyo. “The cultural and creative sector has been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and it is with no doubt that there has been a need for the sector to adjust to the new normal.” Moyo said the award ceremony will recognise creatives who have taken to the emerging platforms for the delivery of creative content by recognising social media skits under the Spoken Word Category. “Generally, the submissions received this year exhibited a lot of artistic depth across all disciplines, while in some categories, like dance, there was a reasonable and considerable decline with sub-standard entries being submitted for consideration,” he said. “We also observed that in some areas, like music, there were significant numbers of highly competitive products submitted because of the mainly long period of consideration for entries. Covid-19 also proved a challenge for sectors that rely on live audiences for performances or exhibitions. This applied to theatre, spoken word, and the visual arts.” Moyo said the adjudicators commended the originality and innovation exhibited in the entries submitted for the awards. “In music, there was a high number of entries for the nomination period, which presented a challenge in judging music created over such a long period of time,” he said. “Good music tends to replace other good music over time, and this gave adjudicators a torrid time. “There was a considerable increase in the amount of material submitted for the Literary Arts Awards. There were also a lot of good books submitted, while online submissions tended to be of inferior quality, as many submitted unpublished books. There was an impressive increase of entries of books in vernacular. “In the visual arts, adjudicators had difficulties accessing materials as most exhibitions were affected by lockdown restrictions that kept most galleries and exhibitions closed for prolonged periods. “The adjudicators noted a concerning lack of creativity and artistic depth in the dance entries, Some of the submissions were too short to constitute a serious dance production for consideration. However, the adjudicators also noted some improvement in the creation of new site-specific dances, which are choreographed for specific physical settings. “In the film and television categories, the adjudicators were impressed by the submissions for the Outstanding Music Video Award, which made it very difficult to choose the best from the best.” Moyo said the adjudicators felt that the number and quality of entries in the Media Awards were greatly affected by the absence of events in the arts sector over the past two years. Most reporters based their reporting on events, and thus, with few events due to Covid-19, there were very few submissions. “The adjudicators would thus like to encourage journalists to shift their focus from event-based reporting so as to broaden their coverage of events in the CCI sector,” said Moyo.

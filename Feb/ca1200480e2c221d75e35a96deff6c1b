The Herald JOHANNESBURG. – The Pretoria high court has given mobile communication giants Vodacom one month to make “a fresh determination” to Please Call Me (PCM) inventor Nkosana Makate. The ruling delivered electronically on Monday comes after Makate hauled Vodacom back to court after he rejected the cellphone giant’s compensation offer of R47m which was made in 2019. In her 42-page judgment, Judge Wendy Hughes ruled that “the determination (R47m) by the CEO is referred back to Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub who is obliged to make a fresh determination with the following directives: The Applicant (Makate) is entitled to be paid 5% of the total voice revenue generated from the PCM product from March 2001 to March 2021.” “That total voice revenue includes Please Call Me revenue derived from prepaid, contract (both in bundle and out bundle) and interconnect (MTR) fees as set out in the Second Respondent’s annual financial statements,” the judgment stated. Makate, who has had a long protracted legal battle with Vodacom over payment for the “Please Call Me” idea he developed more than 20 years ago. – SowetanLive

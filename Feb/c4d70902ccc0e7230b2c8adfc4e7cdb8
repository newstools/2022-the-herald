The Herald The woman who leaped to her death from a Midtown high-rise on Sunday was former Miss USA Cheslie Kryst, law-enforcement sources said. Shortly before she jumped, Kryst posted on her Instagram page, “May this day bring you rest and peace.” The 2019 pageant winner and 30-year-old lawyer jumped from her luxury 60-story Orion building at 350 W 42nd St around 7:15 am and was found dead in the street below, sources said. “In devastation and great sorrow, we share the passing of our beloved Cheslie,” the former beauty queen’s family said in a statement on Sunday. “Her great light was one that inspired others around the world with her beauty and strength. She cared, she loved, she laughed and she shined. “Cheslie embodied love and served others, whether through her work as an attorney fighting for social justice, as Miss USA and as a host on EXTRA,” her family said. “But most importantly as a daughter, sister, friend, mentor and colleague — we know her impact will live on.” Kryst, who lived on the ninth floor of the building, was alone when she jumped and was last seen on a 29th-floor terrace, sources said. Sources said Kryst left behind a note saying she wanted to leave everything to her mother, a former pageant competitor herself who was crowned Mrs North Carolina in 2002. The note did not include a motive for Kryst’s actions, sources said. “Not only beautiful but she was smart — she was a lawyer,” a police source said of Kryst. “She has a life that anyone would be jealous of . . . It’s so sad.” Kryst, a former Miss North Carolina, won top honours at the 2019 Miss USA pageant, wearing a sparkly winged outfit for the National Costume competition, a nod to Maya Angelou’s “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.” Kryst also worked as a reporter for ExtraTV.— New York Post.

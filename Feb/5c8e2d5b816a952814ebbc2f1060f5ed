The Herald LONDON. — Arsenal face a battle to complete their priority squad business — including signing Bukayo Saka to a new contract — if they fail to qualify for the Champions League football. The Gunners are set to embark on a summer recruitment drive, with two new forwards, a centre midfielder and a right-back on Mikel Arteta’s wish-list. Sportsmail understands signing Saka to a new long-term contract has also been made a priority at the Emirates Stadium. But there are emerging concerns that the task of improving the squad with their preferred options will hinge on which European competition they are playing in next season. In relation to Saka; there is a concern that extending the England international’s current deal, that expires in 2024, will be significantly harder if Arsenal once again fail to finish in the top-four. Saka is widely recognised as one of world football’s best young footballers with clubs across the continent watching developments closely. Liverpool and Manchester United have already been linked to the 20-year-old. Arsenal will offer Saka a big pay-rise on his current deal, understood to be in the region of £35 000-per-week, to put him in line with the club’s highest earners. But money will not be the overriding factor when Saka comes to decide on signing his next playing contract. — Mailonline.

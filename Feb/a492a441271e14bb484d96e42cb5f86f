The Herald KAMPALA. – Valentine’s Day is recognised as a significant cultural, religious, and commercial celebration of romance and romantic love across the world. However, the day is not just about love but it is also seen as a major shopping holiday where businesses take advantage to cash in on their loss. The situation was not any different this year even with Covid-19 still hovering around and affecting economic activities. In Uganda, businesses that cater to romance used Valentine’s Day yesterday to breathe new life into sales. Many here believe the commercialisation of the day has overshadowed the component of love, which is supposed to be the focus of the day. However, others say it is the most romantic day of the year and should not be seen as expensive as portrayed. Chef Maria Aguja, who works at Jokoni Restaurant in Kampala,  said that while Valentine’s Day may be a traditional holiday about love, there’s nothing wrong with the tendency to spend in connection with the day. Love is absolutely free, but Valentine’s Day is not, she said. “No one is saying limit all your love to just Valentine’s Day and spend all your hard-earned savings. But consider it a scheduled romantic day. Take your spouse out, make them forget Covid-19 stress. Do your own thing for once. Book a dinner at one of the luxurious restaurants. Plan for your intimacy, and use this to set new standards in your relationship,” she said. However others also believe, said the day is only manufactured for people who only try to love once a year. –africanews.com

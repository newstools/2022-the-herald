The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo Senior Lifestyle Writer Happy weekend. So, the awards season is upon us. First was the fashion awards — Style Icon Zimbabwe Awards (SIZA) — and today all roads lead to the Newlands Country Club, Harare, for the Zimbabwe Music Awards (ZIMA), then next week its the National Art Merit Awards (NAMA). The SIZA show lived up to expectations as fashion icons and celebrities came dressed for the party. It is true that clothes mean nothing until someone lives in them. What we witnessed last weekend was amazing, I think celebrities, fans and locals were now tired of staying at home due to Covid-19 restrictions and not dressing up. Kudos to some of our local designers for doing what some think would come from the planet Mars. Comedienne Mai Titi had to pull three looks at the awards show, proving her mettle in the fashion world that she can still dominate. Socialite Natalie Mhandu, who scooped the Most Stylish Social Media Personality of the Year award, did not disappoint as well. In fact, she was a show stopper with her garment — cross oxbow corset and nude colour on the lime green lace, with a high slit showing her shimmered legs and a matching bunny ponytail. I am sure Kim Kardashian would have been green with envy after seeing Natalie walking on stage to grab her award. The gents did not disappoint either — from international acclaimed Zimbabwean jeweller Patrick Mavros, musician Nutty O to Mudiwa Hood — one can testify that the gentlemen are also taking their time to dress up. I believe that style is a way to say who you are without having to speak. Most of the gentlemen, if not winners, were dressed by 4May International Men’s wear, including the likes of socialite and model Tino Chinyani who is based in South Africa. <img class="size-medium wp-image-601921" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Untitled-37.mai-titi-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="201" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Untitled-37.mai-titi-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Untitled-37.mai-titi.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> From left, Tino Chinyani, Mai Titi and Mudiwa Hood pose for a photograph at the just-ended SIZA show Speaking of which, congratulations to 4May International for being recognised as the best brand for over a decade for remaining consistent in dressing up local men. The company which now also does styling apart from dressing up, extended its share of prowess by remaining top notch for the upmarket style. According to the team behind them, the award came at a good time when they were opening of other branches regionally. Again, they are not stopping at SIZA as today they are the host and official sponsor for the red carpet at NAMA, definitely, expecting to see fireworks. Dressing is an art and as they say, “fashion is like eating, you shouldn’t stick to the same menu.” Today, Yours Truly will be on the red carpet, not only hosting, but fashion policing. That reminds me, how do we dress for an awards ceremony and red carpet event? Before the attention turns to who wore what — and, crucially, who wore it best, there are some styling secrets and behind-the-scenes deals that go into creating those spotlight-worthy red carpet moments. When a celebrity steps on to the red carpet at any awards show, don’t be deceived by their seemingly effortless demeanour. That ensemble — dress, accessories, jewellery, shoes, hair and make-up included —  is the culmination of weeks, or sometimes months, of preparation. “With awards shows you usually have an idea that it’s not going to be just one, so you need to have a build-up situation,” said Elizabeth Saltzman. “There are so many press days, events, talk shows and screenings, and you have to have a narrative. You want the public to like them and to make them seem accessible. There’s so much that fashion can do and say — it sends messages. You’re not just putting on a frock and walking out the door.” The message is perhaps more important than ever this year. Whether they’re out and about around town or getting all dolled up for a big event, the stars always serve up a healthy dose of style inspiration. Because regardless if they’re running home from the gym or stepping on the red carpet in stilettos, celebs dress to impress. With stylists on speed dial, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that tonight’s event is all about glitz and glamour. Who is going to take the gong for best dressed? Avoid wearing sneakers and soccer jerseys unless it is part of the script tonight. Some women love to show flesh these days, but the trend is the less nakedness, the classy the look.

The Herald DAR ES SALAAM. –  Tanzania’s weather watchdog on Thursday issued an alert over the March-May rainfall season saying the rains will have both positive and negative impacts. The Tanzania Meteorological Authority (TMA) said in a statement the March-May rainfall season expected to be experienced in some parts of the country will have an impact on sensitive sectors, including agriculture and food security, livestock and fisheries, wildlife and tourism, health, water, transport and energy. The rainfall season is specific to areas of the northeastern highlands, northern coast, Lake Victoria basin and the northern part of Kigoma region,. It said periods of enhanced rainfall are expected during March over the northern coast and in April for the north eastern highlands area. According to TMA’s weather forecast, excessive rains may cause excessive soil moisture and hamper field crops that do not require much water, such as maize and leguminous crops. The TMA advised farmers to start land preparation and planting early, using appropriate soil management practices and technology to control soil erosion and nutrient loss, seed and crop selection based on seasonal characteristics. The statement said pasture and water availability for livestock are expected to be sufficient over most areas during the March-May rainfall season. – Xinhua

The Herald CALIFORNIA. — Tiger Woods offered no clues on Saturday as to when he will return to the PGA Tour but did say he will be at the Masters in April to attend the traditional champions dinner ahead of the year’s first major. Woods, speaking on television during the CBS broadcast of the PGA Tour’s Genesis Invitational in Pacific Palisades, California, where he is the tournament host, promised a return to competition even if he doesn’t know when. “You’ll see me on the PGA Tour; I just don’t know when,” Woods told Jim Nantz when asked if it was fair to say he would play on the Tour in 2022. “Trust me, I’d love to tell you that I will be playing next week, but I don’t know when.” Woods was a non-playing host at the Genesis Invitational last year where, two days after the final round, the vehicle he was driving veered across the opposite lanes, collided with a road sign and rolled several times before coming to rest. — Reuters

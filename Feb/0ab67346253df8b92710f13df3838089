WARRIORS captain Knowledge Musona’s team Al-Tai are slowly sinking down the relegation zone after they suffered a fourth defeat in succession on Sunday in the Saudi Pro-League. Musona played 90 minutes as Al-Tai were outclassed 4-1 away to Al-Nassr. This was the Zimbabwe captain’s first appearance since he returned from leading the Warriors at the AFCON finals in Cameroon. He had missed Al-Tai’s previous three games. The side is still to win a match since December 31 when Musona’s injury time strike earned them a sensational 1-0 win over Al-Hazm. Warriors midfielder Marshall Munetsi, who missed the AFCON tournament because of injury, marked his return with a brace in Stade de Reims 5-0 win over Bordeaux in the French Ligue 1. There was also ecstasy for Admiral Muskwe in England after he found the target in Luton Town’s 3-0 win over Cambridge United to progress to the fifth round of the FA Cup. Jordan Zemura was an unused substitute in AFC Bournemouth’s shock 0-1 home defeat to Boreham Wood in the fourth round of the FA Cup. Closer home in South Africa, goalkeeper Edmore Sibanda featured in Tshakhuma Tsha Madzvivhandila’s 7-6 penalty shootout upset over Knox Mutizwa’s Golden Arrows in the Nedbank Cup round of 32. Mutizwa was a second half substitute in the game that ended 1-1 in regulation time before spilling to the shootout. Leftback Ronald Pfumbidzai, who recently found a new home at Chippa United, was also back in the Nedbank Cup action. Pfumbidzai was handed a starting place in Chippa United’s 0-2 defeat to University of Pretoria on Friday.

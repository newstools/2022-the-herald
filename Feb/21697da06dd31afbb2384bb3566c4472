The Herald MIGHTY Warriors coach Sithethelelwe Sibanda has named a 30-member provisional squad to prepare for our Africa Women Cup of Nations (AWCON) football qualifier against Botswana. Twenty-six locally-based players will begin training tomorrow in Harare while four foreign-based players will join on Valentine’s Day when the international break begins. The first leg will be played at the National Sports Stadium on February 18 and the return at Obedi Itani Chilume in Francistown on February 23. A win against Botswana will earn the Mighty Warriors a place among 12 teams to play at the AWCON 2022 finals in Morocco in July. Top four teams at the continental finals will automatically qualify for the 2023 FIFA Women World Cup finals.

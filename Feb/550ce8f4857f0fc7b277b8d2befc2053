The Herald BAMAKO. — Mali on Friday asked France to withdraw troops from its territory “without delay”, calling into question Paris’ plan for a four-to six-month departure and highlighting the breakdown in relations between the two countries. Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga, a government spokesman, said France’s decision last week to withdraw forces that have been fighting an Islamist insurgency was a unilateral move that violated military accords between Mali and France. “In view of its repeated breaches of the defence agreements, the government invites French authorities to withdraw (French forces) without delay,” Maiga said, speaking on national television. Maiga repeated the sentence three times, but did not give a deadline. Announcing the French troop withdrawal last week, President Emmanuel Macron said it would take four to six months. In response to Maiga’s comments, Macron told reporters at an EU summit the withdrawal would be “implemented in an orderly manner so we can continue to ensure the security of MINUSMA (the UN peacekeeping force in Mali) and the security of our forces.” The UN force is examining how its military operations will be impacted by the departure of French troops, the force’s commander Kees Matthijssen said on Friday, stressing a commitment to continue supporting Mali. Relations between Paris and its former colony have deteriorated in recent weeks after the military rulers went back on an agreement to organise an election in February and proposed holding power until 2025. — Reuters.

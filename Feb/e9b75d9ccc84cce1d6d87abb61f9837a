The Herald BEIJING. –  China accused the United States of “playing up the threat of warfare and creating tension”, as US President Joe Biden warned that more than 150 000 Russian troops were still massed near Ukraine’s borders following Moscow’s announcement of a partial pullback. Western nations have suggested arms control and confidence-building steps to defuse the stand-off, which has prompted them to urge their citizens to leave Ukraine because an attack could come at any time. Russia denies it has any plans to invade. “Such persistent hyping up and disinformation by some Western countries will create turbulence and uncertainty to the world full of challenges, and intensify distress and division,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters at a regular briefing in Beijing  yesterday. “We hope relevant parties will stop such disinformation campaigns and do more to benefit peace, mutual trust and cooperation.” “The leadership of the two heads of state, China and Russia, always work to develop long term good neighbourliness and mutually beneficial cooperative relationship on the basis of non-alliance, non-confrontation and non-targeting of third countries,” spokesman Wang added. Meanwhile, Russia’s envoy to the European Union, Vladimir Chizhov, has rejected suggestions that his country is about to attack Ukraine. “As far as Russia is concerned, I can assure you that there will be no attack this Wednesday,” Chizhov told Die Welt. “There will be no escalation in the coming week either, or in the week after that, or in the coming month. Wars in Europe rarely start on a Wednesday,” Chizhov said yesterday. – Reuters/dw.com

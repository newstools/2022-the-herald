The Herald MANCHESTER. — Ralf Rangnick hailed Cristiano Ronaldo’s performance against Brighton as one of the best he’s seen since taking charge. Manchester United moved into the top four in the English Premiership football championship race with a 2-0 win over Brighton at Old Trafford with Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes both getting on the score-sheet on Tuesday night. The 37-year-old ended a six-game goalless drought in emphatic fashion, charging into the heart of their defence, avoiding a challenge and powerfully firing beyond keeper Robert Sanchez. Ronaldo rolled back the years with an impressive display throughout the match and his efforts certainly didn’t go unnoticed by his manager. “Very important not only that he scored but it was an outstanding goal,’’ he said. ‘’It was important for all of us, but his overall performance was one of the best since I arrived here. “It was an amazing goal. Not only an important one but an amazing goal. “Overall it was also a good performance by Cristiano. Energetically he was online, he was always trying to help the other team-mates. “I think in the last weeks that would be the best performance by him and it very, very important for us.’’ While Ronaldo grabbed the headlines, David de Gea spared his team’s blushes at the other end with a string of impressive saves. Rangnick said: “In the last 10-12 games, that has happened a few times. Brilliant save from Jakub Moder and that is why we have one one of the best goalkeepers in the world.’’ Rangnick ordered his wingers to attack Brighton’s centre-backs in order to take control of the game following a sloppy first-half performance. Manchester United recorded a win over the Seagulls as Ronaldo and Fernandes’ goals took them back into the top four. Both goals came in the second half with Brighton dominating for parts of the opening 45 minutes which resulted in the home side being booed off by sections of the Old Trafford crowd at the break. — Metro

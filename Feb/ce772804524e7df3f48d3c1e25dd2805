The Herald LONDON. — Michael Masi has been replaced as Formula One race director following a review into last year’s Abu Dhabi GP, the FIA has confirmed. Masi had been under intense pressure due to is handling of the 2021 finale, namely for the Safety Car decisions that opened the door for Max Verstappen to pass Lewis Hamilton for a controversial race and title win. FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem confirmed a number of structural changes as part of a ‘’step forward for Formula 1 refereeing’’ yesterday, one being that Niels Wittich, former DTM race director, and Eduardo Freitas, WEC race director, will act alternatively as F1’s race director. Masi will be offered a new role within the FIA, which Sky Sports understands will be a safety role. Wittich and Freitas will be assisted by Herbie Blash as the permanent senior advisor, with Blash returning to F1 five seasons after stepping down as deputy race director to the late Charlie Whiting. The new race management team will be in place from next week’s test in Barcelona. A Virtual Race Control Room will also be created, likened to football’s VAR, while direct radio communications between teams and the race director will be removed. — Sky Sports

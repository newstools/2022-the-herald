The Herald London. – British Prime Minister Boris Johnson last night announced an end to all pandemic legal curbs in England, insisting it was time to move on despite political opposition and unease from the UN’s health agency. Two years after Covid-19 sparked the worst health crisis in generations, Johnson addressed parliament to outline his plan, pressing ahead despite news on Sunday that Queen Elizabeth II had tested positive for the first time. The 95-year-old monarch was experiencing “mild cold-like symptoms” but expects to be at her desk carrying out “light duties” this week, Buckingham Palace has said. Opposition parties accuse Johnson of seeking to distract public attention, with his premiership in peril as police investigate a series of lockdown-breaching parties in Downing Street. He is also accused of wanting to appease his own Conservative MPs unhappy at what they see as curbs on public freedoms. Mr Johnson said it “marked a moment of pride after one of the most difficult periods in our country’s history”, with the present mass testing arrangements and self-isolation requirements scrapped. “The pandemic is not over, but thanks to the incredible vaccine rollout we are now one step closer towards a return to normality and finally giving people back their freedoms while continuing to protect ourselves and others.” Pointing to lower mortality and infection rates, Mr Johnson said the clinically vulnerable “will be protected with priority access with therapeutics and vaccines as well”. It says local authorities will be required to manage further outbreaks with pre-existing legal powers, and is expected to phase out free Covid testing for the general public. Robert West, a health psychologist at University College London and member of one of the government’s independent scientific advisory groups, said they were “irresponsible”. – Agencies

The Herald Bridget Mavhimira Lifestyle Writer Not so long ago, going to a pub in Harare was not just for fun, it had become a lifestyle for some. Sadly this is no longer the case as some pubs have since closed, changed the type of business or downgraded their standards. In the midst of this, Covid-19 struck two years ago, making the once much-loved pubs lose their popularity with imbibers. Suddenly, drinkers who used to frequent the remaining pubs ended up being restricted by lockdowns, curfews and limits in numbers for gatherings that came with Covid-19. Not that pub culture is now dead, it is still there, but mostly confined to the informal sector, with illegal outlets such as sheebens now taking centre stage. But the experiences will never be the same. With the Covid-19 lockdowns, a lot of things have changed as people have adopted new ways of relaxing and having fun. In safe tourist countries like Zimbabwe, one of the places a visitor looks for when they arrive is a pub. Many tourists do not like to have their meals in hotels, they want to drink and eat out, especially for lunch and dinner. Locals are also no exception. Now, because of new technologies and the advancement of life, some people own big screen televisions and have established their own bars at home. This means they can drink and watch their favourite sports from the comfort of the home. But for some, this is not satisfying, they will still have that urge to go out even when endowed with such luxuries of life. People still visit pubs to chill and relax after a long day at work, for example, where they can listen to some good music and have a hearty meal. Speaking to The Herald on Saturday, one of the patrons at The Centurion Pub and Grill in Harare said he would prefer going to a pub for various reasons, including that the atmosphere is tranquil. He said the changing times in Harare where it is now characterised by debilitating traffic jams forces some people to while up time in bars while traffic subsidises. <img class="size-medium wp-image-601918 aligncenter" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/pub-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="201" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/pub-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/pub.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> Over the years, especially because of the Covid-19 pandemic and other economic issues, it seems as if pub culture slowly dying. Many pubs have simply shutdown in Harare. Who remembers the vibe that used to accompany Turtles nightclub, which has since closed? Sandro’s pub along Kwame Nkurmah Avenue has long been turned into a church. There was Rumours along Chinhoyi Street, Side Walk in First Street, Bulldogs at the once thriving Greatermans Building along Sam Nujoma Street – all these, and many more are long gone. Norfolk bar, at the former Quality International Hotel along Nelson Mandela, which used to host a resident band, is also no more. Some pubs like Beer Engine on Park Lane, where they would “brew” your favourite beer while you wait a few seconds, has since scaled down operations, the same with Mocardo Bar and Restaurant on Nelson Mandela. Among the remaining bars in the city centre are Oxbow, Boomerang, Eclipse, Akiz – even though these are operating more like night clubs, driving away mature drinkers who were used to pub style. It seems open air joints are now topping the list, if the patrons found there, especially during weekends are anything to go by. This has led to a rise in popularity of such areas as Mashwede and Mega, which have a totally different culture from pubs. Some people have also resorted to outdoors events such as Cook Out, The Big Chill, Fiesta Fiesta, Chill Out and Blow Out which are done at sports clubs on alternative weekends. These events have stolen the limelight from the pub culture, as they are not limited in terms of numbers of attendants. Sports clubs in Harare’s affluent suburbs have become busy every weekend with such activities, attracting people from all walks of life, meeting for a drink and some braai. This has become the new norm of drinking and merry-making in Harare in as much as people would want to frequent pubs and night clubs. Even though pub culture cannot necessarily die, it evolves, as one of the patrons pronounced that “Pub is a lifestyle”, hence Pub is the people and not the preen model. It seems pub culture has evolved into something more than just drinking, it is now about interacting, business networking, especially now after the strict restrictions from Covid-19 when people are trying to catch up. Back then, pub culture was just about going out to eat, drink and having fun, but now it is different. People now align it to business. The culture in itself has taken a paradigm shift as there is more to it. One would go to big organisations to get things done, but that has all changed as there are individual entrepreneurs, so there is need for networking to know who is doing what and where. Jax Nettleton, the operations and marketing director of The Centurion Pub and Grill, formally known as The Keg and Maiden, said pub culture will always be there despite the advent of Covid-19. “There was a time when everyone else was allowed to operate, but operations by pubs and restaurants were always the last to be reviewed,” he said. “Pubs are not just a takeaway. When people are drinking ,they do not really want to drink at home, but they want to be where others are and interact. People want to watch a soccer match with friends and a pub is the right place for that.” People visit pubs for different reasons, be it to have food, interact, drink and relax. Pubs offer breakfast, lunch, supper and dinner. Unquestionably, the pub was the best place to get any beer, be it on tap, tasty food, coffee and live music. Pubs are fairly laid a bit during the week, but during weekends, they are the got to places and lively. Back in the late 1990s, people looked forward to spending time in a pub. And the pubs were living up to expectations, hosting resident bands and discos.

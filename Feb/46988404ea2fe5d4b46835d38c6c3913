The Herald Tesla Inc said on Monday it received a subpoena from the US securities regulator related to a settlement that required chief executive Elon Musk’s tweets on material information to be vetted. The subpoena by the US Securities and Exchange Commission was issued on November 16, 2021 some 10 days after Musk asked his Twitter followers whether he should sell 10 percent of his stake in the company, triggering a stock selloff. As of last close, the electric-car maker’s shares had fallen by nearly a quarter since the tweet. The shares were down 1,4 percent at US$909,98 on Monday morning. The SEC’s latest action, which was disclosed in a securities filing by the automaker, adds to pressure on Tesla from federal auto safety regulators regarding vehicle recalls and investigations related to its driver-assistance software. — Reuters.

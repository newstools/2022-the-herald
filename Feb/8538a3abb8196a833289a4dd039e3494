The Herald LONDON. — Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton called for Formula 1 to ensure race officials were “non-biased” as pre-season testing began on Wednesday. The Mercedes driver, who set the fifth fastest time on day one in Barcelona, said it was “super-essential” for stewards to “have no bias”. He was speaking as he returned to the track just over two months after losing the title in contentious circumstances. Hamilton also called for there to be “more women in the stewards’ room”. F1’s governing body, the FIA, has set up a new race-management structure after race director Michael Masi failed to apply the rules correctly in the title-deciding final race. Masi’s actions were central in the sequence of events that led to Hamilton, who had dominated the race before a late safety-car period, losing the lead and the title to Red Bull’s Max Verstappen on the final racing lap after a restart in Abu Dhabi. — BBC Sport

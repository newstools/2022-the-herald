The Herald LONDON. — Thomas Tuchel admits Chelsea are fighting to “survive” as the spluttering Champions League football holders prepare to face Lille in the last 16 first leg tonight. Tuchel’s side have won their last five games in all competitions, but there was little joy on the German’s face when he reflected on Saturday’s 1-0 victory at Crystal Palace. The honeymoon is definitely over for Tuchel as he approaches the business end of his first full season as Chelsea boss. In just five months in charge last term, Tuchel led Chelsea to the Champions League crown and the FA Cup final, as well as a top four finish in the English Premier League. When Romelu Lukaku was signed from Inter Milan for a club record £97 million, it was expected the Belgium striker would help Chelsea enjoy a period of sustained dominance. Chelsea were tipped to emerge as serious challengers for the English Premier League title and in the early weeks of this season it seemed they might live up to the hype. — AFP

The Herald BENI. — AT least four people were hurt after a bomb exploded at a busy market in the eastern city of Beni in the Democratic Republic of Congo on Saturday, police have said, days after the US embassy in the capital Kinshasa warned of a possible attack. Local police said they were looking for the suspected bomber after the blast in the eastern region where Congolese and Ugandan forces have launched a campaign against suspected armed rebels. “We call on the population to be calm and especially vigilant,” said Beni city police spokesperson, Nasson Murara. Police tended to casualties at the market before taking them to a local police hospital, a Reuters news agency journalist on the scene said. Frank Kasisa, the attending physician at Beni’s police hospital, said four people were in stable condition after being injured in the blast. He confirmed no one had been killed. Stephanie Kahambu, who has a shop inside the market, said the market had been crowded before the explosion. “We heard a bomb explode, and everyone fled in different directions,” Kahambu said. “It’s really sad because I saw four people who were seriously injured.” — Al Jazeera.

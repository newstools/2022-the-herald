The Herald LONDON. — Manchester United stars want Mauricio Pochettino to take over in the summer. The Red Devils are set to step up their search for a permanent boss now new chief executive Richard Arnold is in place. And the word from the dressing room is that they want former Tottenham chief Pochettino to get the nod. Ajax manager Erik ten Hag will also be closely looked at by United’s hierarchy in the coming weeks. Meanwhile — as SunSport reported last month — interim boss Ralf Rangnick still has an opportunity to convince the board he is the man for the long term. However, the fact that current Paris Saint-Germain coach Pochettino has worked in the English Premier League before is seen as a major positive by the current squad. The 49-year-old’s job in the French capital is believed to be under threat this summer. And the end could come sooner if his team lose their Champions League crunch against Real Madrid. The Spanish giants are believed to have Pochettino on their own list of possible successors to Carlo Ancelotti. And United would have to move decisively to get their man. Rangnick — who is due to move into a consultancy role at Old Trafford in the summer — is believed to favour a move for Ten Hag. United were expected to make their move for Pochettino after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was given the boot in late November. However, PSG were not willing to release him as they could not persuade their chosen successor Zinedine Zidane to join them mid-season.— The Sun

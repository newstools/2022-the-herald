The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter ZIFA Northern Region Division One Soccer League sides Herentals Under-20 and Commando Bullets will renew their rivalry when they clash in today’s match day seven fixture at the National Sports Stadium B arena. The two sides’ rivalry dates back to 2014 when they were still in Division Two and were fighting for promotion into Division One. By then it was Commando Bullets who got the ticket first and they went on to battle against Herentals senior side who won promotion as Bullets were briefly demoted. Paul Benza’s Herentals Under-20 are still to taste defeat in the championship race and only conceded their first goal of the season last week against Harare City Cubs. Commando Bullets, on the other hand, are doing well as they are also yet to taste defeat and will be expected to maintain their fine run. Benza said it will be one of his most difficult games so far this season but is confident that his young side will come out with a good result. “We will not read much in their current form as we have been improving with each passing game,” said Benza.

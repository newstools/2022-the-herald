The Herald Gaborone.  –  In a bid to boost agro-tourism, the Botswana government is offering wildlife start-up stock to farmers to keep in their ploughing fields. The government says the move will give locals an improved stake in the lucrative tourism sector. Botswana’s National Parks and Wildlife director, Kabelo Senyatso, said the government will run a pilot project between February and July this year, where farmers will receive start up stock. Each farmer will get five animals per species, Senyatso said. “The species that the department would be availing are impala, gemsbok, zebra, eland and warthog. It is important to clarify that applicants should not restrict themselves to these species, people can keep whatever wildlife that they are keen to keep. It is also important to clarify that the scheme that we are referring to relates to keeping of herbivores. It excludes carnivores,” said Senyatso. He said farmers must meet certain water, fencing and space requirements depending on the species they want to keep. Randy Motsumi, a professional hunter, is keen to keep animals within his holding. However, he is concerned the costs will be prohibitive due to start-up capital required. “This is a very good initiative. But the problem now is the expenses. It is going to be very expensive for an ordinary Motswana. Just fencing will cost an ordinary Motswana over P1 million . So this initiative is good, but it needs a lot of funding,” he said. – allafrica.com

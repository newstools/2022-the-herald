The Herald MILLWALL Football Club youngster Kai Tapiwa Garande has confirmed committing his international future with the Warriors of Zimbabwe in a bid to have a chance to represent his country of origin. The 19-year-old highly rated left-back who was born in England to Zimbabwean parents, signed his first professional contract with the Championship side in October 2021 after leaving Charlton Academy and has been in impressive form for Millwall Under-23s’ leading to his recent invite to train with the first team. Team Zimbabwe UK Chief executive officer and former sports administrator, Marshall Gore, who is also championing the harnessing of talent in the diaspora alongside Zimbabwe Foreign Legion’s Mistry Chipere, confirmed the news from the Zimbabwe Embassy in the UK where the youngster paid a visit along side his father to make his allegiance known. “We are excited to have Kai on our books. The future of Zimbabwe football is bright with the vast talent in the diaspora and at home. If we blend it well we can reach the promised land. #WC2026,” said Gore on his Facebook post. Garande is a talented modern left-back, very good left foot, loves to get forward, strong in defence and definitely a threat in the attacking side of the game. He’s been a target of several clubs including Queens Park Rangers whom he almost joined before beaten to his signature by the mid-table Championship side. Garande is currently recovering from a slight injury he suffered training with the first team and could be seen in the Championship action as soon as he recovers. Garande joins the likes of Admiral Muskwe, Jordan Zemura and Kundai Benyu, amongst others, to have chosen to represent Zimbabwe from the diaspora. — Soca263

The Herald CAIRO. — Al Ahly head coach Pitso Mosimane has stated he would be surprised if he will not renew his contract with the Egyptian football giants. The 57-year-old South African tactician’s current contract runs until the end of the season and talks are understood to be ongoing over an extension of his stay with the club. “I have five months left on my contract, and I believe we will renew, and if we do not renew, I will be surprised,” Mosimane told On The Whistle. ‘’I’ll repeat it to the next guy (who comes along), ‘I don’t know what you’ll have to win’. It will be tough for the guy unless he is sentimental.” The three-time CAF Champions League winner also commented on whether he will take a chance, if it presents itself, to coach in the English Premier League. “It is good to be acknowledged, I appreciate that. Well, every coach aspires to be in the English Premier League. — Goal.com

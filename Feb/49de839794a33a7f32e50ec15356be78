The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo-Senior Lifestyle Writer It is show time and the script is screaming. May the best performer win! This is no mere hyperbole and true to its grandeur, glitz and glamour the night yearns. Tonight all roads lead to the Harare International Conference Centre for the 20th edition of the National Arts Merit Award (Nama). <img class="size-full wp-image-603257" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Nicholas-Moyo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Nicholas-Moyo.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Nicholas-Moyo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> National Arts Council of Zimbabwe director Nicholas Moyo (centre) flanked by Napoleon Nyanhi (left) and Elton Kurima of Gateway Stream. Prestige and pride are at stake. And, so is the talent being put to test and taste. Today is the D-day for all and sundry. Today is D-day for the best of the best and time, they say, is the best teacher. What seemed a long time of preparations has finally landed on the table and all is set. This is the biggest award ceremony in the country and it opens or closes the awards season. In fact, I prefer to call them our Zim Oscars. Get your tuxedo, bow-tie, designer outfit, make-up ready, mask up if you can. For the past two years due to Covid-19 pandemic restrictions and guidelines, the organisers couldn’t host the glitz and glamour event. Some close sources revealed that last year they tried to do a virtual gala like Grammy set up, having 100 people in physical form and the rest on online screens but it did not pass. Today they are tested on their prowess as they have to prove to the Zimbabweans that for the past two years they have been cooking something we all could feed and be full. This time around no loopholes as they have learnt from the previous edition. Remember they are the ones who two years ago gave us a splendid show with a rendition of “Ngaibake” song by Alick Macheso, Freeman and Ammara Brown, lighting the auditorium with fire ululation and thunderous applause. <img class="size-full wp-image-603253" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Macheso-and-Ammara-Brown.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Macheso-and-Ammara-Brown.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Macheso-and-Ammara-Brown-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sungura ace Alick Macheso, Freeman and Ammara Brown as they perform ‘Ngaibake’ at the last event. Since they are the biggest, believe you me, all eyes are on them, reason being of late our local awards ceremonies are usually marred with disorganisation, confusion and technical glitches. A survey by this reporter revealed that it is only in Zimbabwe where our awards ceremony focuses on technical rather than respecting the nominees as guests yet alone for those shows to happen it is about nominees. No wonder why we end up having some artistes dissociating themselves from the show and sometimes even do not attend as they have lost respect. Awards shows are about nominees, winners and partying. Losers too! Period. When we start talking about mismanagement then definitely we are still far from hosting one. We should start investing in the ceremony as it promotes tourism. Be creative. <img class="size-full wp-image-603254" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Takudzwa-Chihambakwe.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Takudzwa-Chihambakwe.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Takudzwa-Chihambakwe-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Takudzwa Chihambakwe after receiving an award at the last NAMA edition. Kudos to the organisers for respecting the red carpet affair. Zimbabweans now know how to dress the part and when it comes to having an award ceremony that is the first aspect to work on. Taking a leaf from neighboring countries or going further in a ship, the Europe side, the red carpet affair are the biggest shows when hosting awards. They take about four hours hosting the show unlike her in Zimbabwe the longest being one hour the rest are pictures taken on a banner. We just need to appreciate the norm set up. Last week the NAMA team released the list of performers. I don’t doubt their stage set up because they once proved that they are meeting international standards, even Beyonce Knowles, Coachella project manager could be green with envy. Well, again last week the social media was craze with the Super Bowl Halftime LVI showcase featuring Dr Dre, Mary J Blidge, 50 Cent, Snoop Doog and Eminem, for about 15minutes, they had the stage lit. Imagine NAMA with two hours. Well, let’s wait and see, the reason I am bringing such comparisons it is because they ahve the resources, they cups wont run dry, it is just their creative mind. For tonight, they have gospel songstress Janet Manyowa, Nutty O, Enzo Ishall, Mookomba, Awa Khiwe, Kae Chaps, Crooger, Minister Micheal Mahendere, Mambo Dhuterere, Nyasha David and Junior Brown among others. From the lineup,definitely one is expecting fireworks because these artistes when they host their gigs, they make sure they try to bring what we see in their videos. Please NAMA don’t disappoint. Oh, by the way, it is a black boy madam . . . remember the line from the local movie Yellow Card. Yes, South African based Zimbabwean actor Leroy Gopal returns as the host for the show. Who doubts his charisma and energetic moves? Last edition he brought the house on fire when put up a well-choreographed act joining the dancers on his opening act. Gopal, what are you bringing this year? For an award ceremony to flow it needs a script from the presenters to backstage, good lighting, time management, sitting arrangement, gongs, performances, sound and graphics among others, all these will be accounted for by critics. This year they are running under the theme, “Zimbabwe and Beyond #Amalevels”, undeniably the bar you once set is high, tonight bring the amalevels as you have highlighted. However, the notion that what is killing the awards locally is organizers and relatives of sponsors  who are not giving each other time and space to breathe. I know we are in the awards seasons but believe you me, have you noticed somehow it is the same presenters, hosts, sponsors, services providers running the show. Last week we were at the Zimbabwe Music Awards (ZIMA) and we still nursing the wounds, seven days later back to attend the NAMA’s. Won’t they get tired and can’t we give sponsors value for their money and addition. Last week we had so and so sponsoring ABC awards and this week is the same. Grammy and Oscars they don’t compete with each other but compliment hence the time frame rather why can’t we take a leaf from South Africa. See you on Monday and rather next year again. Zimbabweans are begging that this year prove to the locals by giving them different headlines from the critics. My senses are telling me all is well, if managed well. Congrats to the nominees and may the best wins. Don’t forget to bring the fashion statements.

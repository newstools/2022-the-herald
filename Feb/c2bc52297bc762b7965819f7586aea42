The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter KARATEKA Hlonipha Ngwenya is appealing for partners to come on board in his RHN Taekwondo Club project in Chitungwiza as he says he is fighting drug and alcohol abuse in the dormitory town. The club, which is less than a year-old, has managed to attract over 200 members. Ngwenya has taken the initiative to take young, aspiring karatekas off the streets. The second-dan black belt holder opened the club last year in March as a way of taking the youths off the streets where they abused drugs. Ngwenya is hopeful to have more students and encouraged members of the society to take the sport seriously as it can be a professional career. “I started RHN Taekwondo Club, which is based at Makoni in Chitungwiza, so as to help aspiring karatekas to have self-defence and promote healthy living. “When I started it was a hobby of training youngsters, but we have now grown and have more than 200 participants who are under the club. My challenge is that of sponsorship as we resort to hiring equipment such as Tatami. “The sport is growing big and we are happy that the girls are also involved as we have more than 30 girls who have joined us. My intention is to help the people to have knowledge in the sport and take it professionally. “My youngest student is four years old and the eldest is a 62-year-old, which means we cater for all the age-groups. I am grateful to the parents who have been supportive throughout,” said Ngwenya. Ngwenya, who has partnered with several business people in and around Chitungwiza, said some come with evil intentions. “Ever since I started the club there were different individuals who wanted to partner me but I realised their intentions was to take over the club. Some would come with good intentions but instead of bringing some sponsorship, they will interfere with the day to day affairs of the club,” said Ngwenya.

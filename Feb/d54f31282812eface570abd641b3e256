The Herald The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) said on Wednesday it had registered close to 50 000 new voters between February 1 and 20 as it ramps us preparations for next year’s general elections. The electoral body is on a month-long mobile voter registration outreach, which runs until February 28th.

Highest province being Harare on 16 437 and least being Mat North with 2091,” said ZEC. The second phase of the registration blitz will run from April 10 to 30.

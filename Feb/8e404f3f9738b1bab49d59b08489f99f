The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter ZIMBABWEAN professional golfer Scott Vincent returned to the Asian Tour where he is taking part in The Saudi International at Royal Greens Golf and Country Club in King Abdullah Economic City, Saudi Arabia. Vincent, who is currently the highest ranked local professional, had a decent round of level-par 71 and tied on position 44 after yesterday’s first round. The Saudi International is the first tournament on the Asian Tour and Vincent is a tour card holder who had some outstanding outings last season when he mainly focused on the Japanese Tour. The 29-year-old Vincent is part the strongest field ever seen in an Asian Tour event and will be in line to make at least US$13 000 by making the cut with the winner expected to walk home US$900 000 richer. A total of 65players will make it to the last two rounds after today’s second decisive round. Littered with major winners like Bryson DeChambeau, Phil Mickelson, Sergio Garcia, Shane Lowry, Graeme McDowell, Henrik Stenson and defending champion, Dustin Johnson, the tournament also sees an increase in prize money for 2022. A further investment from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), the total purse is now US$5 million, a US$1.5 million increase from last year’s US$3.5m. Formerly a DP World Tour event, the tournament now features under the Asian Tour banner and Zimbabweans will be eager to see if Vincent will continue with his fine form there. This is a result of the ongoing threat of the Saudi-backed Super Golf League. Last year, the tournament was won by two-time Major winner, Dustin Johnson, who claimed the title with a final round of 68 giving him a two stroke victory and his second title at the Saudi International in three years. With an even bigger field announced for 2022, the American will be hoping to scoop the US$900 000 first prize and make it a hat-trick of Saudi International victories.

“This first full electric vehicle is intended to provide Agilitee customers with peace of mind and comfort when seeking to travel longer than normal distances,” he said. He added that leveraging green energy, green technology and innovation was the best way of showing utmost confidence in building a truly carbon free society. “As much as the vehicle has received international regulatory approvals and will be sold globally Africa remains the main market,” Dr Lamba said. “Africa is now officially in the forefront of the green revolution because of this, people will travel with no worries of charging and most importantly using nature to charge therefore not spending a dime on fossil fuels. What excites me the mist is that our people will drive free of charge.” The car comes with a 300km range if charged and also self-charges, 1100p HD reverse camera with a large central screen, sensitive and quick response combined hydraulic breaks, front and rear impact guard with a side protection for all occupants and blue tooth hands free calls among others.

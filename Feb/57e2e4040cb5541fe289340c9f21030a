The Herald Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter TADIWANASHE Marumani scored his maiden first class century as Southern Rocks amassed a record 512/8 declared against Alliance Health Eagles in a Logan Cup cricket match currently underway at Old Hararians. The top order batsman’s 102 runs gave the winless Rocks a memorable innings, as four other players weighed in with half tons, in almost two days of batting. The 20-year-old batted for over seven hours in all before he fell lbw to Tapiwa Mufudza in his patient build up to his maiden first class hundred. Marumani made his first class debut last year and has played eight first class cricket matches. His 153-run partnership for the first wicket with Innocent Kaia (88) was key. Then there were fifties from the Northamptonshire professional Ben Curran (75), Tafadzwa Tsiga (84) and William Mashinge (59). Alliance Health Eagles wobbled in response and had been reduced to 117/6 at lunch on Day 3, today. They had resumed their innings on overnight score of 34/2. Scorecards at Stumps on Day 2:

The Herald LONDON. — Mikel Arteta has hit back at Pierre Emerick Aubameyang’s suggestion that he was the problem after the striker left the English Premiership football club to join Spanish La Liga giants Barcelona. Arteta says he was “the solution, not the problem” in his relationship with former Gunners striker Aubameyang. Arteta also confirmed that French striker Alexandre Lacazette will be the Arsenal captain till the end of the season, when the 30-year-old’s contract is due to expire. Aubameyang left Arsenal for Barcelona on Deadline Day after being stripped of the captaincy at the Emirates in December following a disciplinary breach. Speaking at his official unveiling as a Barcelona player last week, Aubameyang said: “I think it was a problem just with him (Arteta). I can’t really tell you much. He wasn’t happy and that was it. I can’t say anything else because that’s what happened. I wasn’t very happy and I’m better this way.” Asked about those comments ahead of tonight’s trip to Wolves, Arteta said: “It’s his opionion. That’s his opinion, that is what he said and you have to respect that. “I am grateful for what Auba has done at the club and his contribution since I have been here. The way I see myself in that relationship is the solution, not the problem.” “I think it ended up in the best possible way for everybody. I think when things change, and the context changes and this is part of football. — Sky Sports.

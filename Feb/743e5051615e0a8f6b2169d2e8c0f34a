The Herald Yaoundé. —  Senegal are through to their third Africa Cup of Nations final with Sadio Mane on target to help them overcome Burkino Faso. In an eventful game, VAR chalked off two Senegal penalties, with Burkina Faso goalkeeper Herve Koffi injured during the events of the first. Abdou Diallo and Idrissa Gueye put Senegal in charge before Blati Toure narrowed the deficit late on. But Mane chipped in to settle victory for the tournament favourites. Senegal will face Egypt or hosts Cameroon in Sunday’s final (19:00 GMT). Burkina Faso will take part in the third/fourth-place play-off, which has been brought forward a day to Saturday (also kicking off at 19:00). BBCsport

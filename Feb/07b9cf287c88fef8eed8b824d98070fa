The Herald Herald Reporter Contrary to social media reports, Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) co-vice president Mr Tendai Biti has not been arrested, but was only questioned by police before being released. Informed sources told The Herald that there was a slight misunderstanding between Mr Biti and the police. The stand-off has since been resolved. Posting on their Twitter handle, the pro-opposition Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights confirmed the release.

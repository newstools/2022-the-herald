The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — South African football fans are planning to stage a protest during the upcoming Soweto Derby between Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs on March 5 to demand a return to stadiums. Fans will gather outside Orlando Stadium to demand a return to stadiums after being prohibited from attending live sporting events. Football lovers have been banned from stadiums since March 2019, due to government safety protocols due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The National Football Supporters Association are now preparing a demonstration as a follow-up to a previous protest held by the EFF. “It has been 19 months since supporters were last seen at stadiums due to the Covid-19 pandemic and as an organization, we have tried all measures within our capacity to engage SAFA, the Ministry of Sport and the PSL regarding a return to stadiums,” NAFSA acting CEO, Siyabulela Loyilane tells KickOff. — KickOff.com

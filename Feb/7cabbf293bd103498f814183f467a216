The Herald LONDON. — Jack Wilshere will not be the highest-paid player at his new Danish football club AGF. SunSport can reveal the ex-Arsenal midfielder will be on £5 000 a week before bonuses at his new club. AGF’s top earner is believed to be defender Frederik Tingager (28), who earns around £6 700-per-week. Meanwhile, captain Patrick Mortensen (32) is believed to take home £5 700-a-week. Wilshere (30) had been training with the Gunners while searching for a new club. And Wilshere has found a new home in Denmark with AGF confirming the deal on Sunday. Manager Stig Inge Bjornebye said: “He is in good physical shape, but of course lacks some combat training. “It will probably come, and we look forward to seeing him in the white jersey when he has fallen well into place.” — The Sun

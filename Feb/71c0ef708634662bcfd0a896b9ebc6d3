The Herald LONDON. — Cristiano Ronaldo is setting a poor example to the rest of Manchester United, says former player Paul Ince, who believes that the superstar forward has drawn too much attention from the rest of his team-mates. The veteran forward made a much-heralded homecoming at the start of the season to the club where he made his name, but his Old Trafford homecoming has gradually morphed into a nightmare in recent months, having now endured his longest barren run for over a decade. The 37-year-old has cut an increasingly conflicted figure since, and while Ince acknowledged that the Portuguese is now a different man to the player who first graced the club, his attitude has nevertheless failed to inspire influence around a group struggling for form. “This is not the Ronaldo of 19 years ago when he was first at Old Trafford — this is a 37-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo,” Ince told Genting Casino. “When people say he’ll be great for the club and the youngsters, you’d have thought that would be the case. “But he’s walking off down the tunnel and throwing his toys out the pram. For me that’s a bad example. — Goal.com

The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo-Senior Arts Reporter Argh, Nama!!!, again! Many thought we were going to call out Nama (National Arts Merit Awards) three times like we did with ZIMA (Zimbabwe Music Awards) last week, to correct their mistakes. No. Nama is the mother of all awards in Zimbabwe. But its 20th awards event held at the Harare Conference Centre during the weekend left some wondering why give people the same old script riddled with so many glitches. Well, the organisers did put all their efforts to bring the show back after two years’ hiatus because of the Covid-19 pandemic. And many thought the hiatus was going to serve as a blessing in disguise to come back bigger and better, but that was not the case. It was the same modus operandi, but this time around it seemed like the steering wheel was not steady or the driver was sleeping on duty. What was wrong this time around? The show was much hyped and many anticipated smooth awards night. A chat this reporter had with some of the close associates of the NAMA days before the event showed that there were some loopholes like lack of finances, manpower and resources to match NAMA’s big dreams. Because they were limited in their creativity because of finances and resources, the script was supposed to change before the big day. What really happens with the local awards shows? Is it lack of appreciation or preparedness from the organising teams? When it comes to such awards, it should be about winners, nominees, performances and obviously the losers too. But for local awards, these are always affected big time by some last minute loopholes which hinder the awards show from being progressive. There is need to change the narrative on local awards ceremonies are handled, if they are to be taken seriously by regional and international counterparts, including the local artistes. There was nothing new to write home about at NAMA 2022. It was just a lukewarm show, like something on the calendar that needed to be fulfilled like we do with Christmas. Compared to some of the regional and international awards which we watch yearly, there is always a new aspect. Here are some of the take home items at the awards show: The bad and ugly We choose to start off on the bad note because the trend is continuing to bug such awards and something needs to be done to correct the anomaly. The awards started off late as they have done in previous editions. It seems punctuality is never in the manual for NAMA. Before that, the red carpet somehow lost the spark as it seemed not to be scripted. It seemed the organisers forgot that the red carpet is a show on its own and needed to be taken care of. Imagine having interviews on the red carpet while some guests walked about in front of the camera! The ushers somehow did not do their job thoroughly. Although the presenters nailed their job well, they ended up being everywhere trying to talk to some guests who shunned the red carpet. In a normal set up, red carpet guests are told to be on the carpet at a certain time for the interviews and they honour that instruction. To make it more interesting, why not just play with your fashionistas and designers if you want to bring the glamourous look. Then the show started. There were technical glitches from sound to the graphics and like previous awards, “darkness” visited the stage for some minutes. South Africa-based Zimbabwean actor Leeroy Gopal, turned up in a nice suit. And what does he do? He starts by announcing National Arts Council director Nicholas Moyo’s name as Michael Moyo. Did he have a script or was there a teleprompter to assist him? Mistakes are common, but forgetting the actual name of the awards organiser is unforgivable. It means from the start, people will be in doubt of the show’s flow if such avoidable mistakes are allowed. In the VIP and VVIP area, it seemed the organisers oversubscribed the guests, resulting in some being seated where they were not supposed to seat. Some presenters acted or were dull on stage during their presentation, and it was so embarrassing to the extent they ended up calling the chief co-ordinator on stage. And all this was being beamed live on television. The sound too was pretty bad. NAMA organisers must realise that it is still professional to give presenters their script even a week before the event so that they understand their lines rather than going on stage with a bunch of papers like they were invigilators coming from a Geography examination class. We are in the 21st century! A tablet would do for such a prestigious awards show instead of papers that are shuffled endless on stage. Again, some errors needed to be avoided, like when some presenters went on stage to present a different award and someone had to go on stage to correct them. The biggest lesson for NAMA is to ensure that everyone sticks to the script — that is if it is there in the first place. The voice over felt a bit awkward, at some point not coherent and not in sync with the graphics. The good and the best Congratulations for hosting such a prestigious event. Winners walked away richer and with gongs compared to other awards shows. When it comes to having performances at NAMA, it is always electrifying, and this time around the script was the same. The opening act of the tribute to the late Soul Jah Love by various Zimdancehall artistes was top notch, besides the sound technical problems. NAMA resurrected the spirit of the liberation hero. The closing act by Nutty O and Nyasha David was also magnificent. <img class="size-full wp-image-603430" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Nutty-O.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Nutty-O.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Nutty-O-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nutty O Nyasha David came on a motor bike on stage like what United States rapper Busta Rhymes does, while Nutty O proved that the gongs he bagged were worthwhile as he was dressed like a king out to conquer the world. Kudos to NAMA for the creativity. The lightning was amazing, and thanks to Gateway Stream Music for streaming the event for free to the Diaspora market. The set up and sitting arrangement was excellent — typical of the Oscars set up style for television. Despite his earlier slip on Moyo’s name, Leeroy Gopal should be made a permanent NAMA host just like Steve Harvey is to the Miss Universe pageant. He connected well with the audience and he sailed through even when faced with some technical glitches. Gopal remained calm and on the rails, a sign of maturity when it comes to presentation. <img class="size-full wp-image-603429" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Madam-Boss.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Madam-Boss.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Madam-Boss-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Madam Boss and husband Ngoni Guests were dressed to the point, with the long red carpet backdrop giving everyone a share of space to take some selfies. Moyo’s speech was eloquent, taking guests through the Nama journey. Minister of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation Kirsty Coventry’s speech was also spot on. It was everyone’s hope that NAMA’s next edition will be better. Below is the full winners list: NATIONAL ARTS COUNCIL OF ZIMBABWE 20th NAMA EDITION NOMINEES 1.

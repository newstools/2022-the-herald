The Herald CALIFORNIA. — Former world No.1 golfer Tiger Woods admitted on Wednesday that he’s making slow progress with respect to the injuries sustained from his car wreck of nearly one year ago. Woods is still hopeful of returning to the PGA Tour but says that remains a long way off as he continues his recovery from serious injuries sustained in a car crash last February. The 15-time major champion showed glimpses of his past best during a runner-up finish alongside his son, Charlie, in his first competitive appearance since the accident at the PNC Championship in December. The 46-year-old admitted amputation of the leg “was on the table’’ during his three weeks in hospital after the crash and has already ruled out a full-time return to professional golf — but featuring at tour events remains a possibility. “I wish I could tell you when I’m playing again. I want to know, but I don’t,” the 15-time majors winner said during a news conference at the Genesis Invitational. “My golf activity has been very limited. I can chip and putt really well and hit short irons very well, but I haven’t done any long stuff seriously. I’m still working. “I’m still working on the walking part. My foot was a little messed up thereabout a year ago, so the walking part is something that I’m still working on,working on strength and development in that. It takes time — Reuters.

The Herald Business Reporter OLIVINE Industries, one of Zimbabwe’s largest food producers, will commission two new production lines in August this year as the company seeks to expand its domestic and regional production capacity and food supply, chief executive Sylvester Mangani said. The new lines will produce margarine and tomato source. “Between now and July, we will be receiving various pieces of machinery; some is already on the site and we are targeting to launch the new plants in August,” said Mr Mangani. In 2019, the African Development Bank approved a US$8,25 million corporate loan to Olivine Industries to support the company’s food production expansion plan. However, Olivine,  had to use its own resources after the regional bank delayed release of the funds.

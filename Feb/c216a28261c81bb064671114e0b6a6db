The Herald Miriam Nyasha Kwari Herbalist Hello friends… This week I would like to share and give you all a little taste of a vegetable that could change your lives for the better. Remember that your food is your medicine and all what you eat will determine the type of life you will live. With that, I welcome you all to another edition of “Your Health is your Wealth”. Broccoli A member of the huge cruciferous family, along with cabbage, kale and cauliflower, broccoli stands out as a healing food that developed from the wild cabbage native to Europe and the Mediterranean area. Growing Broccoli During the cooler months and even deep into winter, start several batches of seeds so that you can have continuous batches of broccoli coming along. In very hot summers broccoli does not thrive and is often riddled with aphids, scale and black fly. Using Broccoli It has been advised that one and a half cups of broccoli lightly steamed a day can protect against several cancers, particularly breast cancer, colon and lung cancer, but also cancer of the oesophagus, pharynx, larynx, stomach and prostate . Broccoli and other dark green vegetables like cabbages and spinach help fight irradiation as well, and as our daily exposure to irradiation in cell phones and computers increases we should be aware of broccoli and its ability to protect. Smokers should also seriously include broccoli in the diet at least 3 times a week to protect the lungs. Make sure that you give me a call so that we can sit down and make a proper diet sheet for you. This diet sheet will contain everything that you need to eat to ensure that you stay healthy and vibrant. Furthermore, remember Graviola — the essential immune booster that works well with these healthy foods. God bless you all and look after yourselves.

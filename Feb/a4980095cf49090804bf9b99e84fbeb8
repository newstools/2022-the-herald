The Herald ANTANANARIVO. – Two people are missing and 885 have been displaced in northeastern Madagascar by tropical storm Dumako, the National Office for Disaster Management reported Wednesday. The storm hit Madagascar’s Soanierana Ivongo area on Tuesday at 3pm with winds of 65km per hour, gusting to 90km per hour. Heavy rains were reported as the storm moved across the island to the Analanjirofo region. Dumako is forecast to continue moving westward to bring winds and rain to northern Mozambique, according to meteorology offices in southern Africa. “The winds from storm Dumako are not as strong as those from Cyclone Batsirai. But you have to be careful about floods and landslides which could cause deaths,” the director-general of Madagascar’s disaster management officer Gen. Elack Andriakaja said. He said food supplies are sufficient to assist victims. Earlier this month, Cyclone Batsirai hit eastern Madagascar, causing 121 deaths and displacing 143 000 people. It is Dumakoh will bring heavy rains to the provinces of Nampula in the north of the country, and Zambezia and Sofala, in the centre, accompanied by severe thunderstorms and strong winds. – Washingtonpost.com

The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo Fashion 263  Today is fashion Saturday as all roads lead to the giant auditorium of Harare International Conference Centre (HICC) for the inaugural Zimbabwe Fashion Awards.  Definitely something to look for as most local fashionistas will have a chance to showcase their stuff, proving their mettle.  May the best fashionistas win.  Trend-zone defined wear embraces innovation. Still on the fashion news, local brand Trend-zone owned by Florence Rupapa today also holds a first ever brand activation as a way of announcing their new product lines and services to their fledgling business.

In two days it’s Valentine’s day.  While Valentine’s Day is often called a “hallmark holiday,” it does at the very least focus the attention on spending quality time with the one you love.  It is a perfect day to go on a romantic date with your significant other, even if you aren’t going any further than your dining room you should still know how to dress for the day and what are the best Valentine’s outfits for this romantic evening?  I had a chat with fashion stylist guru Boss Chimedza from 4May International who even shared some ideas on what to wear and how to dress for Valentine’s Day with your beloved.  But first we check on the ladies.  Red is considered the colour of love and passion, so red is definitely an obvious choice if you are choosing how to dress for Valentine’s Day, and there’s a shade of red that will suit all skin tones, whether you opt for a shade which has more orange or more blue in its mix.  For a more romantic feel, you could add a touch of pink to your outfit.  Some suggest that you can just wear any colour which makes you feel great.  I also think that the day is the perfect time to wear tactile fabrics such as silk or satin, or to choose chiffon with a camisole worn underneath.  4May gentlemen tips  When it comes to the day , well some men find it difficult to dress up.  Regardless of who you’re with, dressing up will show that you care to be with your friends or date by putting thought into what you’re wearing.  Whether you’re going on a date to a fancy restaurant or going to a party with your friends, here’s a selection of great outfits that you can wear. <img class="size-full wp-image-600955 aligncenter" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Untitled-39-copy.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Untitled-39-copy.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Untitled-39-copy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> What you wear depends on what you’re doing.  The following from 4May International are outfit examples based on the occasion.  Casual and laid back  If you are going to the movies, going on a coffee date, or taking a walk in the park, keep it casual. A pair of dark denim that fits well is essential. Next, find a nice sweater, jacket, and solid sneakers to complete your look.  Whether you’re going on a fancy dinner date or taking a casual stroll in the park for Valentine’s Day, learn how to dress for it.  Going to a show  Shows and performances are great options for Valentine’s Day dates. Although you don’t want to be too casual or formal, you should dress up by wearing chinos or trousers, nice boots, and an overcoat.  The dinner date  If you’ve made reservations at a nice restaurant, dress up and enjoy yourself. A suit without a tie is the perfect outfit to wear. Make sure your white shirt is clean and crisp. Remember, dressing well affects more than your appearance. When you dress well, you’ll feel more confident, and it’ll show others that you care.  Then on to good news, Paco Robane brand has announced their latest fragrance, Phantom. <img class="size-full wp-image-600958 aligncenter" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/phantom.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/phantom.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/phantom-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Good thing it’s in Harare.  ‘Go hard or go home’ is a phrase that might easily describe the approach taken by Paco Robanne when they were working on their recently released fragrance, “Phantom.”  From the scent composition to the bottle design, they went all out in ensuring that their fragrance makes noise on the market. Phantom is a woody aromatic fragrance for men which was crafted by four master perfumers namely Anne Flipo, Dominique Ropion, Loc Dong and Juliette Karagueuzoglou. The noses behind this release have separately worked on some exquisite fragrances for designers that include Burberry, Calvin Klein, Carolina Herrera, Alexander McQueen, Amouage, Dior, Giorgio Armani, Givenchy and Jimmy Choo to name just a few.  The note breakdown for Phantom includes lavender, lemon zest, Amalfi lemon, apple, smoke, earthy notes, patchouli, vanilla and vetiver.  Paco Robane has described their new baby as, “The essence of self-confidence fueled by feel good energies. A futuristic aromatic fragrance born from the clash between luxury craftsmanship and new-tech.  Using a cutting-edge creative process to select ingredients to make you feel energised, powerfully confident and sexy. A bold scent with notes of addictive creamy lavender, fusing energizing lemon and seductive woody vanilla.”  The house has once again proven why they are the best in the business with this release which is certainly on point.  This fragrance will certainly get you plenty of compliments when you are wearing it.  In the opening you can pick out the lemon and vanilla fusion which gives you a really fresh and sweet scent.  In terms of longevity, this can last past the eight-hour mark which means you can spray in the morning and expect to be smelling nice the whole day. While the designer house has never held back when it comes to presentation, having delivered some of the most memorable fragrance bottles over the years, the design on their recent release is a bit daring.  The robot inspired bottle does not only look futuristic, but actually does embrace new technology as it is NFC enabled.  Tapping your NFC enabled phone on the top of the bottle will automatically open a site where you can get digital trinkets on offer including interactive filters, personalised playlists and augmented reality filters to name a few.  In Zimbabwe Phantom is available in numerous reputable outlets including Catts Beaute, Edgars, Licorice, Kenlink and Booties among others.

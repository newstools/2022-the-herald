The Herald MANCHESTER. — Pep Guardiola insisted Manchester City did not need to lose to understand how hard defending the English Premiership football title will be after a 3-2 defeat to Tottenham on Saturday let Liverpool firmly back into the race. The reverse at home means the champions remain on 63 points, six ahead of the Merseyside club, having played one more match than Jürgen Klopp’s team, who are City’s visitors on April 9. Guardiola said: “We didn’t need to lose a game to know how hard it is (to win the league). There are many, many games still to play. I said a few weeks ago that we needed a lot of points and that it was going to be so difficult because the teams we are playing are fighting for the Champions League or the Europa League or not to be relegated. “There are still a lot of games to go and a lot of points to play for and we know how difficult it is. All of the UK knows how good he is.” — The Guardian

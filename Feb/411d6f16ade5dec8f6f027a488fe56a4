The Herald Court Correspondent Harare Magistrate Mrs Letwin Rwodzi has set February 24 as the trial date for builder George Katsimberis who stands accused of duping a land developer of close to USS$1 million in a joint venture to build cluster houses in Harare’s Borrowdale suburb. Soon after the trial date was set, Mr Charles Warara who is representing George Katsimberis stood up and made an application for the recusal of senior prosecutor Mr Michael Reza from his case arguing that he is biased and would not give him a fair trial. Through his lawyer Mr Charles Warara, Katsimberis claimed Mr Reza has a biased interest and was acting in a manner that is not acceptable. “Mr Reza is taking sides against my client whom he said must be prosecuted and in the perjury case is saying the witnesses in this matter must not be prosecuted, which is unacceptable,” said Mr Warara. Mr Warara also claimed that Mr Reza, in his mind, acquitted engineer Zvenyika Chawatama and others in the perjury case and has convicted his client in this current matter which is totally unacceptable.  Responding to the application, Mr Reza said there  was no application before the court. “There is no such reference as to which law the defence is basing  its application on,” he said. Mr Reza also denied taking sides, saying Mr Warara was now inviting him to take his client’s side which he said he will not do. Mr Reza further submitted that in terms of the statutes, there is no application before the court.

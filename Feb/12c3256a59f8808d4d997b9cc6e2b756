The Herald Ellina Mhlanga Sports Reporter GEMS’ captain Felisitus Kwangwa finally joined her English side Surrey Storm for the Vitality Netball Superleague after some delays that saw her failing to join the team before the 2022 season got underway. Surrey Storm re-signed Kwangwa after her debut season with the club last year. She returned home after the final game of the season since her contract was running up to the end of the 2021 season.  However, her performance from last season seem to have impressed the English side as they roped her in for the 2022 programme that got underway at the beginning of this month.   Kwangwa was expected to return to the United Kingdom after leading the Gems at the Pent Series and Africa Cup tournaments that were held in November last year. But there were some delays and she missed the pre-season preparations and some opening games for the season which got underway on the weekend of February 5 and 6.  However, she is now with the club and speaking to the club’s media team this week, Kwangwa said she is excited to be back with the rest of the team.  And she is looking forward to their upcoming home opener against Loughborough Lightning on Monday night at Surrey Sports Park. “I am super excited. I can’t wait to have my first game here. “I really had great time to play for my nation again after two years due to Covid and I have been preparing very hard so that I could match with everyone who was here since I joined the team a bit late. “I would like to say to our fans I will be super excited to play with you watching, which is something that did not happen last season, so it will be my first home match, and I am really really excited,” said Kwangwa. Surrey Storm have so far played two matches and lost both.  They were scheduled to take on Team Bath, at Bath Sports Village last night.

Carnival spokesperson Darryn Lee said this year the adventure festival was bigger and better as it was packed with activities. “From the adrenalin-pumping adventure activities, an incredible landmark setting and a music-loving crowd, all mixed with local and international music-fans celebrating an artist line-up that showcases the best talent from around the African continent,” he said. “Following the major success of the last nine years, the Victoria Falls Carnival has once again created an ideal way to spend three days over a long weekend at a tourist destination.” Lee said the carnival would celebrate diverse culture, food and arts. “We have chosen a long weekend that offers festival-goers more competitive packages, a wider selection of artistes from around the continent, and great weather that allows you to see the Victoria Falls in all its glory after the summer rains,” he said. Lee said funds raised through this exclusive competition as part of the activities will go to their partners at Victoria Falls Wildlife Trust to help in the conservation of the Victoria Falls region, which directly uplifts local communities through employment and education. The carnival director, Craig Bright, said there were reasons behind switching the venue for the event. “We have decided to move the venue to Elephant Hills Hotel as it’s more suited to a music festival of its size,” he said. “We have unfortunately outgrown the school venue –  and the fact that we can use the hotel as a base for all our artistes and crew, and for accommodating our festival fans, makes it an ideal venue. “There is also more space to accommodate the festival, and the venue is on the beautiful Zambezi River with incredible views. It is also close to the sunset cruise boats, and other activities on offer in the Victoria Falls. “We see more room for growth at this venue and it’s a great way to start our new journey after the long break due to the pandemic and celebrate our 10th year.”

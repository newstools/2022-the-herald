The Herald Gold prices eased yesterday, as the dollar and Treasury yields firmed on prospects of aggressive interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, while fresh concerns over Russia’s attacks in eastern Ukraine lent some support to the safe-haven metal. Spot gold was down 0,2 percent at US$1 942,93 per ounce, as of 0140 GMT, after hitting a more than one-week high of US$1 949,32 earlier in the day. US gold futures were up 0,2 percent at US$1 949,00. The US dollar index was steady after topping 100 for the first time in nearly two years on Friday on bets of aggressive Fed measures to contain soaring inflation. A stronger dollar makes gold less attractive for other currency holders. The 10-year US yield hit 2,73 percent on Friday, its highest since March 2019, as traders bet on a more hawkish Fed stance. — Bloomberg.

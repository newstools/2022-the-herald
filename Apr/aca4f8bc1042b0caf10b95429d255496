The Herald ZIMBABWEAN students, who are set to leave for Russia on a Presidential scholarship programme, have been urged to represent the country with distinction and not to abuse the life-time opportunity. This was the message during the send-off ceremony of the 51 students in Harare this Thursday. Bidding farewell to the students who will study at various universities in the Russian Federation, the Permanent Secretary in the Office of the President and Cabinet, Mr Solomon Mhlanga said that the Zimbabwe Russia Bilateral Scholarship Programme is reflective of the good relationship that exists between the two countries. He also urged the students to be good ambassadors of Zimbabwe in Russia. “This programme is reflective of the good relations that exist between our two countries. This is a lifetime opportunity, grab it and represent the country well while abroad,” said Mr Mhlanga. The Russian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Nikolai Krasilnikov said the programme is one of the ways of cementing diplomatic ties between Moscow and Harare. The Presidential and National Scholarship Programme has over the years benefited thousands of students who have gone for university studies in countries such as Russia, South Africa, India and China. One of the key target areas of the Zimbabwe-Russia bi-lateral relations is the education sector. The 51 students were set to leave for Russia in 2020, but were delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic. – ZBC.

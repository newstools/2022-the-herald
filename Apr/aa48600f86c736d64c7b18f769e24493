The Herald LONDON. — Arsenal have banned questions on Gabriel Jesus ahead of the summer transfer window in a telling response to the English Premiership football club’s transfer plans. Mikel Arteta has made signing a striker this summer a priority after losing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang at the end of January while Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah are out of contract in June. Several have been linked in recent months including Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Victor Osimhen and Alexander Isak. But one name has shot up the list to become a potential priority in the form of Jesus from City, where they are prepared to let him leave. With Erling Haaland seemingly on the way, room must be made to accommodate the 21-year-old and the Brazilian is the one on the chopping block. Arteta knows the 25-year-old well from his time coaching him under Pep Guardiola and is aware of all of his attributes. Jesus’ four-goal haul against Watford has also proved that he knows where the net is. However, the Gunners are desperate to keep their cards close to their chest and went to measures to prevent any sort of speculation from getting out. According to Brazilian outlet Globo Esporte (via Sport Witness), Arsenal directly asked ESPN Brasil — who interviewed Edu at the weekend — not to ask him questions about Jesus. The former Palmeiras man has largely been used out wide by Guardiola, who has opted against using strikers for many of his games this season. — The Daily Star

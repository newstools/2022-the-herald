The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — South African Premiership football club SuperSport United have already started planning their squad reshuffle for the new season with one of their internationals heading for the exit. SuperSport sacked Zimbabwean coach Kaitano Tembo last week following a poor run of results after four years at the helm. Information reaching this website is that his fellow countryman Kuda Mahachi is also heading out upon the expiry of his contract with the club having taken the option of not renewing. Mahachi (28) joined SuperSport three years ago after spending a season with Orlando Pirates but has battled for regular game time this season. The Zimbabwe international has nine appearances this season. He has put in a full 90-minute shift just once and has not featured in the last nine games with his last appearance having come on February 15. His first two seasons with Matsatsantsa were productive as he piled up 62 appearances. Capable of playing anywhere on the left channel and cutting in from the right, Mahachi’s availability will ignite interest considering his experience. SuperSport are understood to be working on a plan to continue trimming their salary bill and turning to youth like they have done of late with almost three-quarters of their squad aged 24 and under. Mahachi has played in the PSL for eight years having started out at Mamelodi Sundowns. Also leaving at the end of the season is Buhle Mkhwanazi (30). Mkhwanazi has not played this year after choosing not to get vaccinated, which is against the club’s policy. — KickOff.com.

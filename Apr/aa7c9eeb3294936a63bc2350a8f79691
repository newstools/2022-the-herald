The Herald AUBURN. — The Tiger Trail has eight more members. And Auburn has eight more ways to celebrate the legends of the past. A crowd of more than 100 gathered inside Neville Arena on Friday evening to welcome eight former Auburn University Tigers to the local version of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The Tiger Trail places engraved stones honouring former athletics greats in the sidewalk of downtown Auburn in a joint effort by the city and the university. At the ceremony, inductees offered remarks and pulled from a random draw the placing for their stone in the downtown sidewalks. “I’m so honoured to have my name submitted with the great likes of so many great Auburn men and women that are here before us — that paved the way for people like myself and the many that are coming behind me,” former Auburn basketball star Marquis Daniels said. “I walked in as a young man that, you know, was kind of lost and didn’t have my way — but Auburn accepted me and I love being an Auburn man.” The City of Auburn and its chamber of commerce held the event for the first time since 2018, honouring its biggest class since 1996, when it inducted 13 members in its second year of existence. Daniels (men’s basketball), Emily Carosone (softball), Zimbabwean Kirsty Coventry (women’s swimming), Jimmy Dozier (men’s track and field), Chip Spratlin (men’s golf), Stan White (football), Joe Whitt Sr. (football/administration) and Greg Williams (equestrian) were all honoured. “One of the things that I have really come to enjoy about being in Auburn is the town-gown relationship, and recognising how important it is that the city of Auburn and Auburn University work in concert with one another,” Auburn athletic director Allen Greene said. “And it’s events like this, and ceremonies like this, inductions like these. It’s the fact that we get to walk and see the names of famous, important student-athletes and those who are meaningful in our community.”— Opelika-Auburn News.

The Herald Kudakwashe Mugari in MAPUTO, Mozambique ZIMBABWE and Mozambique yesterday enhanced their long-standing relationship through the signing of an agreement establishing a Bi-National Commission (BNC) that was accompanied by the adoption of agreements and Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs) in various fields to enhance co-operation. The signing of the MoUs in the fields of Energy, Justice, Science and Technology was witnessed by President Mnangagwa and his Mozambican counterpart, President Filipe Nyusi. President Mnangagwa is here on a three-day State visit, his first since coming to power, as he continues to engage and re-engage the world, entrenching ties with friendly nations while reaching out to formerly hostile countries. Before the signing of the agreements, President Mnangagwa, who was received with a 21-gun salute, inspected a guard of honour and then had a tete-a-tete with President Nyusi. The four MoUs signed yesterday transformed relations between the two countries from the level of a Permanent Joint Commission, chaired by Ministers of Foreign Affairs, to a BNC, chaired by Heads of State. The first and main agreement was signed by the two countries’ Foreign Affairs Ministers with Ambassador Fredrick Shava representing Zimbabwe, while Veronica Macamo Dlhovo represented Mozambique. The other three sectoral MoUs that were signed are co-operation in the area of Justice and Legal Affairs — signed by Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Minister, Ziyambi Ziyambi, and his counterpart, Hertha Kida; an MoU in Co-ordination of Aeronautical Search and Rescue Services signed by Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister, Felix Mhona, and his Mozambican counterpart, Janfar Abdulai, and the MoU on Science and Technology in the areas of Higher Learning signed by Professor Amon Murwira and Mr Daniel Nivagara of Mozambique. <img class="size-medium wp-image-610072" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Untitled-39.thbge3_-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="201" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Untitled-39.thbge3_-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Untitled-39.thbge3_.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> President Mnangagwa and President Filipe Nyusi witness Higher and Tertiary Education, Innovation, Science and Technology Development Minister Professor Amon Murwira and his counterpart from Mozambique Minister Daniel Nivagara exchange files after signing MOUs in the areas of higher learning yesterday Yesterday’s historic event also reviewed the status of bilateral relations, taking note of growing co-operation in trade and investment, transport, energy, tourism and environment, defence and people-to- people relations.

AFCFTA is one of the flagship projects of the African Union Agenda 2063.

We value the deep relations we have shared since the time of the liberation struggle,” she said.

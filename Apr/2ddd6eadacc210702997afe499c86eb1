The Herald Sports Reporter THE visiting South Africa A yesterday held on to a 36-run victory over Zimbabwe XI to claim the three-match one-day series at Harare Sports Club. The tourists bagged the series 2-1 after recovering from a five-run defeat in the series opener earlier in the week. Opening batsman Tony de Zorzi (78) and Khaya Zondo (60) held the SA ‘A’ innings together as they posted 287/9 in their 50 overs after the visitors had lost the toss and were asked to bat first. The home team fell short in the chase and were bowled out for 251 runs in 47.2 overs. Kelvin Kasuza was the top scorer with 66 runs while Donald Tiripano narrowly missed a third List A 50. South Africa A had a good foundation with De Zorzi and wicketkeeper/batsman Ryan Rickelton (47) putting on 98 runs for the first wicket in exactly 19 overs. But the top order was kept in check by left arm spinner Wellington Masakadza who finished with a four-wicket haul. Masakadza removed the top four batsmen to give the hosts a fighting chance against the visiting team, which comprised mostly the Proteas fringe players. Rickelton was his first victim before returning to claim the scalp of Reeza Hendricks (14) and de Zorzi. However, South Africa A still looked good at 147/3 after 28.5 overs. The visiting skipper Heinrich Klaasen (17) was next to fall to Masakadza before Zondo launched a middle order resistance. He was bowled out by Tendai Chatara for 60 runs off 69 deliveries. Andile Phehlukwayo was unbeaten on 29 off 25 deliveries as Tanaka Chavanga cleaned up the last three wickets. Zimbabwe XI’s chase got off to the worst possible start after losing Takudzwanashe Kaitano for a single midway through the second over. Number three batsman Prince Masvaure was moving at tortoise’s pace before he was dismissed for just nine runs after gobbling 19 deliveries. Kasuza, who had opened the innings with Kaitano, was fast running out of partnerships as Zimbabwe XI found themselves teetering on 85/5, before they had even faced half their allotted overs. The required run rate was working against them but positive cricket in the lower middle order by Richmond Mutumbami (39 from 37), Donald Tiripano (48 from 35) and Masakadza’s run-a-ball 32 ignited some faint hopes. But the South Africans were determined. Phehlukwayo returned with the ball to haunt the Zimbabweans with his 4-32. Gerald Coetzee took 2-40. With the one-day series taken by the visitors, the teams will now engage in five T20 games that are set to get underway at the same venue on Monday. 3rd one-day Result: South Africa-A 287/9 in 50 ov (De Zorzi 78, Zondo 60; W. Masakadza 4-44, Chivanga 3-43) beat Zim XI 251 all out in 47.2 ov (Kasuza 66, Tiripano 48; Phehlukwayo 4-32, Coetzee 2-40) by 36 runs

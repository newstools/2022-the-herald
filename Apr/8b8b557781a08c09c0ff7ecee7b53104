The Herald LONDON. — Wayne Rooney says Manchester United must move on from superstar players like Cristiano Ronaldo and Paul Pogba. The Red Devils record scorer revealed the English Premiership football club need to axe both players in order to progress. Rooney was asked by Sky Sports presenter Dave Jones whether Ronaldo’s emotional return to Old Trafford had worked out as planned. And he resoundingly answered: “You’d say no at the minute. He’s scored goals, he’s scored important goals in the Champions League early on in the season. He scored obviously the hat-trick against Tottenham. “But I think if you look to the future of the club you would have to go with younger, hungry players to do the best to lift Manchester United over these next two, three years. “And obviously Cristiano is getting on a bit.” Rooney went on to suggest that 37-year-old Ronaldo doesn’t offer enough throughout the course of 90 minutes on the pitch. Instead, he doubled down on the Red Devils switching their recruitment policy to offer opportunities to “young, hungry players”. — The Sun

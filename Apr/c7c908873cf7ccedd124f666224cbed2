The Herald LONDON. — Liverpool are planning to offer Sadio Mane a new contract but will not break the bank to keep him, Football Insider understands. The Senegal international, who turned 30 this week, has just over 12 months left on his current deal and talks are yet to progress on an extension. A recruitment source has told Football Insider that Mane wants to stay at Anfield and Liverpool’s powerbrokers want to keep him. But owners Fenway Sports Group are mindful of the costs of handing out mega long-term contracts to Mane as well as Mohamed Salah given their ages. Like with the Salah deal, it will come down to finance and both parties compromising. The source added that Mane will not get a “huge” deal that would shatter the club’s pay structure. Mane nonetheless believes he is deserving of a lucrative new deal on the back of what has arguably been the best season of his Anfield career. The forward has reacted to the £50million January signing of Luis Diaz by thriving in a new central striker role. He scored twice on Saturday as Liverpool booked their place in the FA Cup final with a stunning 3-2 win over Man City. In 41 appearances this season, Mane has 18 goals and two assists to his name. The ex-Southampton star has also excelled on the international stage this year. He helped Senegal win the African Cup of Nations and qualify for the World Cup. — Football Insider

The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter THE second leg of Zimbabwe’s Triple Crown, Zimbabwe Guineas, will have a small field of four runners at Borrowdale Park and racecourse on Sunday. Call The Wind who has been doing well in the previous events has been ruled out of the Zimbabwe 2000. The starting stalls on Sunday will have Tigers Eagle, Cutback, Master King and Regulate. Rodgers Satombo will ride Tigers Eagle, and Teaque Gould will be on Regulate who are probably the pick of the day, but none of the runners can be discounted, as all will be racing over 2000 meters for the first time. Tigers Eagle, the winner of the 1600 meters Tote Free Handicap, was second to Call The Wind in the recent 1800 meters Silver Slipper, while the lightly raced Regulate was only a quarter of a length behind Call The Wind in the 1600 meters Zimbabwe Guineas on March 6. Regulate and Tigers Eagle are yet to take each other on but, Twice Over filly, has been well held by the later previously. Cutback’s stablemate, Master Ming, will have Kevin Derere on board.

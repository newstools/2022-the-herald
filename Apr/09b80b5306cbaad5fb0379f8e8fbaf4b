The Herald Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE international Tino Kadewere was an unused substitute as French giants Olympique Lyon kept alive their hopes in the Europa League with a 1-1 draw against 10-men West Ham in the first leg of their quarterfinal clash at the London Stadium on Thursday night. Kadewere had to spend a miserable 90 minutes on the bench with Lyon coming back from behind to get a vital point in England. Tanguy Ndombele levelled the matters midway through the second half after a defensive howler in the 52nd minute had led to a shock opener for West Ham via Jarrod Bowen. The tie is evenly balanced ahead of the return leg at Groupama Stadium next Thursday. But before that, Lyon travel to in-form Strasbourg tomorrow evening, where a win would be a big step for them in their quest for European place next season. Lyon have had a difficult season and are currently in ninth place after 30 games. Kadewere has not been able to command a regular starting place in the team. Since his return from injury, he has been coming from the bench in the few league matches he has been given a run. He has made five appearances in the European competition this season and is still to open his scoring account, having featured 198 minutes in total since making his Europa League debut against Danish side Brondby IF in September last year. Apparently, Kadewere has struggled to reproduce the form that made him a darling of the Lyon fans last season after scoring only once in five cameos.

The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter CHAPMAN and Royal Harare will co-host the 2022 FBC Zimbabwe Open Golf Tournament for the first time in over a decade. Chapman last played host to the country’s premier golf event over 15 years ago but got the thumbs up to stage it this year from Sunshine Tour director, Gary Todd, who was in the country ahead of the launch of the event on Wednesday. The Eastlea-based club was referred to as worldclass and is capable of hosting any international tournament. With a total of 192 players expected to grace this year’s event, which has a R2 million purse, organisers saw it befitting to use two clubs with 96 players at each course. After the qualifying round on Friday, the 60 players who would have made it, will then round off the final two rounds at Royal Harare. Todd said he was happy with the quality at both clubs and urged members and administrators to keep up the standards. “We are happy that we will have two worldclass golf clubs hosting the 2022 FBC Zimbabwe Open golf tournament and after I had a walk on the two courses, I was satisfied and I hope the management will continue with the good work until we get to the tournament,” said Todd. Meanwhile, Visitor Mapwanya has claimed the top spot at the on-going ZPGA Harare Classic after he followed up his opening round of level par 72 with a two-under 70 at Chapman yesterday. Mapwanya, who has been playing in the Safari Tour, will go into today’s final round ahead of day one leader Jack Allard and Zambian Sydney Mwemba by a single shot. Allard and Mwemba are all on one-over-par overall. Never Milazi managed to maintain his fine form as he finished on level par after also dropping a shot, having carded a one under on the opening day. On one over are Nashi Muyambo and Tafara Mpofu as the tournament reaches its climax today.

The Herald Crime Reporter EIGHT people died while 14 others were injured in separate road traffic accidents which occurred in Harare and Bulawayo yesterday morning. The Bulawayo accident involved a commuter omnibus which collided with a haulage truck and claimed the lives of six people, while the other one in Harare involved a Honda Fit which rammed into a train along Chiremba Road near OK Mart in Hillside. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the accidents.  “The ZRP confirms a fatal road traffic accident which occurred at the intersection of Masiyephambili and Khami Road in Bulawayo today (yesterday) at 5am hours where six people died while 11 others were injured. “A non-Zupco Toyota Hiace Kombi with 17 occupants went through a red robot and rammed into a moving truck before it was trapped between the horse and trailer and dragged for about 30 metres,” he said.

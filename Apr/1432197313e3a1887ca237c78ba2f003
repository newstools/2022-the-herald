The Herald MANCHESTER. — Ralf Rangnick has warned that it could take 18 months to completely fix Manchester United’s issues and make them a force to be reckoned with again. Rangnick admits his Manchester United players are lacking physicality and aggression and claims it will be difficult for the next manager to change the DNA of the ‘’technical’’ members in the squad. Despite a promising summer in the transfer market with the arrivals of Cristiano Ronaldo, Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane, it has been another hugely disappointing season for the Red Devils as they have once again fallen way short of English Premiership football title contenders Manchester City and Liverpool. Rangnick replaced Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in the dugout in November, but is facing a battle to qualify for next season’s Champions League — a 1-1 draw at home to Leicester on Saturday left United in seventh place and three points behind the top four. The German is set to take on a consultancy role at Old Trafford in the summer and he has already made recommendations to the club’s board about how a long-term rebuild should be structured. It centres around United’s next permanent manager, with Ajax’s Erik ten Hag still the favourite for the role and PSG boss Mauricio Pochettino also in the running. “Manchester City and Liverpool… have been built together and recruited over a period of five or six years — all of them under the premise of how the coaches want to play,’’ Rangnick said. “I told the board this is what has to happen (at United). “Whenever the new head coach is clear, it has to be: how does he want to play and what kind of players do we need for that? “Then we come back to DNA, speed, physicality, tempo. What do we need? This team does not lack technical players, it can do with more physicality. “It takes right decisions and (clarity over) where you want to go: what kind of players, what kind of manager and then, in every transfer window, try to get the best possible.  — Mailonline.

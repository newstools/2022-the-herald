The Herald Prosper Dembedza-Court Correspondent A 59-year-old Masvingo farmer yesterday appeared in court after he was found in possession of 52 crocodile skins worth US$78 000, without a licence. Duncan Andrew Wadley was facing charges of contravening the Parks and Wildlife Act when he appeared before Harare magistrate Mrs Yeukai Dzuda. He was freed on $20 000 bail. The court heard that Wadley gave his accomplice Vimbai Dzingirai, who is also on remand on this case, the 52 crocodile skins to sell and she allegedly kept then at her house in Mabelreign, Harare. It is alleged that on March 27, detectives from CID Minerals Flora and Fauna Unit in Harare received information that Dzingirai was in possession of the crocodile skins without a valid permit at her house. The detectives went to her home to verify the information, searched the house and discovered 52 crocodile skins stashed in six white sacks. They asked her to produce a permit authorising her to be in possession of crocodile skins, to no avail. She then implicated Wadley, who was in Masvingo, as the owner of the skins and the one in possession of the permit. Detectives recovered the crocodile skins and took them to their offices pending production of the required permit. A Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority official assessed the skins and confirmed them to be Crocodile skins and valued at US$78 000.

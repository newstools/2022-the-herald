The Herald Senior Court Reporter THREE men have appeared in court on allegations of conning a local company running a hotel in Harare of nearly $9 million in a botched groceries and personal protective equipment (PPE) supply deal. Tatenda Takawira, Luckmore Jonasi and Donald Chikwiramakomo, appeared at the Harare Magistrates Court on Wednesday facing charges of fraud. They allegedly defrauded Sogecoa Zimbabwe (Private) Limited, which was being represented by its marketing manager Mr Emmanuel Mukwara. Represented by lawyer Mr Terrence Nyadundu, the trio was not asked to plead to the charges when they appeared before magistrate Mrs Yeukai Dzuda. They were remanded to April 26 on $50 000 bail each. Appearing for the State, Miss Caroline Mutimusakwa alleges that on March 28, Sogecoa Zimbabwe (Pvt) Ltd wanted to secure some groceries and PPE for its hotel. Mukwara was then told that the three were in a position to secure the goods they required and approached Jonasi and Chikwiramakomo, who told him that they would engage Takawira and Fortunate Brighton Maregedze, who is still at large. Mukwara was then linked to Maregedze, who confirmed that they could supply the goods he required. Chikwiramakomo allegedly gave Mukwara an NMB account number for Mohammed Mussa Wholesalers and another NMB account number for Zorway International (Pvt) Ltd where Mukwara deposited $3 780 000 and $5 000 000 respectively for the groceries and PPE. The trio allegedly promised to deliver the goods on the same day, but failed. They excused themselves saying Mukwara had deposited the money late and would supply on the following day. It is alleged that they also failed to deliver the goods as promised, prompting Mukwara to take the matter to the police. Mr Mukwara only recovered US$8 000, which was equivalent to $1 160 000 on the day’s prevailing foreign currency auction rate and promised to deliver the balance on the following day. It is said that Mukwara and his company lost $8 780 000.

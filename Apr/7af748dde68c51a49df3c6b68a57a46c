The Herald Shares in Twitter Inc fell after Elon Musk decided not to join the board, after speculation the world’s richest person could mount a takeover of the social media platform. After discussions with management, Musk decided against joining Twitter’s board over the weekend, a dramatic reversal that also ends a previous agreement to keep his stake at no more than 14,9 percent. Twitter shares fell about 7 percent in pre-market trading yesterday in New York. The drop erases part of a week of gains after Musk revealed he had taken a stake, with investors seeming to welcome his investment. Musk is now free to increase his stake in Twitter and push for changes in the company as an activist investor, which has also set off speculation that he may be interested in an acquisition of the company. — Bloomberg.

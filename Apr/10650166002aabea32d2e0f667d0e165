The Herald HAMILTON. — David Moyo has not hit 10 goals in a season for three years — but he’s keen to hit the landmark for Hamilton this term. The Zimbabwean forward scored his ninth of the campaign for Hamilton against Morton at Cappielow on Saturday in the Scottish Championship football action, his strike from close range after six minutes sealing a 1-0 win. Starting his fourth term at Accies this summer, the 27-year-old is keen to continue upon the goal trail for boss Stuart Taylor. While wonder goals have been few and far between, Moyo insists hitting double figures for the first time since his 14-goal haul at previous club St Albans City would be a fine achievement. He said: “I last hit double figures before I came here. It would be (a decent achievement). I just want to keep improving and keeping adding to it (his tally). “Hopefully I can do that next year as well. It was Conference South level last time so it’s good to be doing it up here. “It doesn’t matter how they go in, I just need to be there! The gaffer has worked on some things with the attacking players on being in the right place at the right time. “So credit to him for that. We just need to keep improving and working on it, as it seems to be working.” — Daily Record

The Herald PARIS. – French President Emmanuel Macron has won a second term in office, defeating his far-right rival Marine Le Pen by a comfortable margin in a runoff election. His supporters erupted with joy on Sunday as the results appeared on a giant screen at the Champ de Mars park by the Eiffel tower. World leaders were quick to congratulate Macron, some reflecting relief at avoiding a political shock in one of the European Union’s most pivotal countries. In his victory speech, Macron acknowledged that many had only voted for him just to keep eurosceptic Le Pen out and promised to address the sense of many that their living standards were slipping “Many in this country voted for me not because they support my ideas but to keep out those of the far-right. I want to thank them and know I owe them a debt in the years to come,” the 44-year-old said. He also promised to address the “anger and the disagreements” that led to many French voters choosing the extreme right, saying “this will be my responsibility and that of those around me”. – Al Jazeera

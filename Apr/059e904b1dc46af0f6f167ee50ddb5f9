The Herald LONDON. — Manchester United star Paul Pogba has reportedly opened talks about a free transfer to PSG this summer — with United fans welcoming the news online. Pogba’s contract at Old Trafford expires at the end of the season and at this stage an extension seems unlikely given the uncertainty surrounding the manager’s position as well as his own form. The French World Cup winner – who previously played for Juventus before re-joining United for £89m in 2016 – has long been linked with a move abroad and French outlet Footy Mercato state that brining Pogba in is PSG sporting director Leonardo’s top priority this summer. The report adds that the 30-year-old is keen to make the move to the French capital, while former club Juve are not interested in bringing him in on a free. It is understood the midfielder is keen to join the French giants at the expiry of his contract this summer, having snubbed United’s efforts over a new deal. While remaining at United has yet to be ruled out, Pogba has been frustrated during his time in Manchester, failing to compete for the titles he had envisaged when re-joining the club from Juventus for £89m in 2016. A number of top European teams, including the likes of Real Madrid and Juventus, have been linked with making a move for the midfielder. — Mailonline

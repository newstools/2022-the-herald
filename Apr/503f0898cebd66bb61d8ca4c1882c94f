The Herald LONDON.  — Manchester City’s pursuit of Erling Haaland has taken a significant step forward, with the English Premiership football club agreeing terms with the player’s representatives. Sportsmail understands that a suitable financial package – which would make Haaland the English Premier League’s highest-paid player on more than £500 000 a week — has been given the nod. City are now expected to trigger the 21-year-old striker’s £63 million release clause at Borussia Dortmund and, if all goes according to plan, what is likely to be a five-year deal should be sealed in the next week or so. Last week, Dortmund insisted that nothing had been agreed and added that they were seeking a conclusion with others, including Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, in the hunt. There was a hope the player would extend his contract for a year. But City have remained quietly confident throughout the process and are now closing in on the prolific forward manager Pep Guardiola craves. The Spaniard missed out on bringing Harry Kane to the club last summer, and despite topping the English Premier League, City have at-times looked short up front. — Mailonline

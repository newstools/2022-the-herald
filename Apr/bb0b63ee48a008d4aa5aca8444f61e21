Following a robbery incident which occurred at Innez Mine, Kadoma on April 25, 2022 at 2300 hours, the police crack team on armed robbery intercepted the suspect’s Nissan Caravan vehicle (AFH6988) which was used during the robbery and flagged it stop. “The suspects tried to attack police officers with machetes and a shootout ensued resulting in the arrest of three suspects.

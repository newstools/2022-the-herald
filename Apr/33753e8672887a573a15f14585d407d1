The Herald Tadious Manyepo Sports Reporter DYNAMOS and Highlanders players will walk away with an extra US$200 bonus if they win their respective Premiership matches this weekend courtesy of principal sponsors Sakunda Holdings. The two giants are bankrolled by the energy concern who have, outside their formal agreements, been giving some extra incentives to the teams since their marriage commenced last year. And this week, the entity has tabled the bonuses as a way of motivating the teams ahead of their scheduled clash in the President’s Independence Day Trophy final at Barbourfields on April 18. Dynamos today have a tricky away tie against Ngezi Platinum Stars at Baobab while Bosso will host newboys Cranborne Bullets at Barbourfields tomorrow.
And should the teams win, their players will smile all the way home with the US$200 cash bonuses. Sakunda Holdings project coordinator, Nqobile Magwizi told The Herald last night his organisation will pay the once-off bonus in cash. “Sakunda Holdings, being the principal sponsors of Dynamos and  Highlanders Football Clubs and valuing the importance of the Independence Cup, will be giving incentives to players from the two clubs ahead of their clash on Independence Day on 18 April, 2022. Each player will get a once-off payment of US$200 for winning this weekend’s Premiership matches. “This is just a noble gesture to motivate the players ahead of the Independence Day clash between the two clubs,” said Magwizi. Both teams have gone for the last five matches without losing in the marathon, with the Glamour Boys winning all of those games whilst Highlanders have won twice and drawn thrice. Sakunda Holdings have already set aside the cash incentive for both teams whom they want to be as competitive as they can when they meet in the Uhuru Cup final in Bulawayo. While nothing has been said yet, The Herald understands the energy giants are also preparing something big for both teams in the Independence match.

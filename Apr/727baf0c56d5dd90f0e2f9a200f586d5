The Herald UNITED States-based top Zimbabwean amateur golfer Kieran Vincent captured his 25th career top-10 finish on Tuesday by finishing in third place at the Lewis Chitengwa Memorial Golf Tournament which was hosted by the University of Virginia in honour of his compatriot who passed away in 2001. Vincent, who is a senior at Liberty University, carded a 7-under par 206 (72-64-70) during his three trips around the Birdwood Golf Course (par 71, 7,058 yards), Virginia’s home golf course Charlottesville. The third-place showing was aided by a career-low round of 8-under par 64 during the second round. His 64 is tied for the third-lowest 18-hole score in program history. He finished five shots behind Tennesse’s Spencer Cross, who claimed his first career individual tournament championship with a  three-round total of 12-under par. Cross’ title carries extra significance for Tennesse as his university team’s head coach Brennan Web was Chitengwa’s roommate on the Canadian Tour at the time of his passing in 2001. This week’s inaugural Lewis Chitengwa Memorial was named in honour of the former Virginia All-America golfer Lewis Chitengwa, who passed away at age 26 as a result of meningitis. At the time, he was competing in the Canadian Tour’s Edmonton Open. It was also significant for Kieran Vincent as he had the opportunity to play in a tournament named after his late compatriot at such a high level in the United States. Vincent, who is individually ranked No. 46 in the US, has now posted 25 career top-10 finishes during his career at Liberty, which ranks second to Liberty Athletics Hall of Famer Robert Karlsson (31 – 2009-12). As a team, Liberty finished the event in sixth place with a 6-under par 846 (285-279-282). The Flames finished 11 shots behind Virginia, who won the event on its home course with a score of 15-under par 837 (279-278-280). The event marked the conclusion of Liberty’s regular-season schedule. Vincent and the Liberty Flames will now turn their attention to defending their ASUN title at the 2022 ASUN Men’s Golf Championship, April 24-26, at the University of Georgia Golf Course in Athens, Georgia. The rising Zimbabwean golf star will be aiming to finish his collegiate career on a high before he joins his brother Scott on the professional ranks at the end of the current season. — ZimSportLive.

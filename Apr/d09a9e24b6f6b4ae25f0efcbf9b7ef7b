The Herald Alphabet Inc.’s Google lost its court fight to topple a €150 million (US$163 million) French fine for mistreating companies using its online advertising platform. The Paris court of appeals backed a 2019 decision by antitrust regulators who said Google abused its dominant position in search to set unfair rules for its Google Ads platform. The judges said in their Thursday ruling that the tech company’s rules “have been defined and applied in a non-objective, non-transparent and discriminatory manner.”  While Google’s antitrust run-ins in Europe have cost the tech giant billions of euros, the 2019 decision by the Autorité de la concurrence was its first such fine in France. — Bloomberg.

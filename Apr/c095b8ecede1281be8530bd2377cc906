The Herald Sports Reporter A DAY after celebrating his birthday, all-rounder Sikandar Raza was in excellent form with the bat as he led the Zimbabwe XI team to a five-run victory over the visiting South Africa A in the first one-day match at Harare Sports Club. The match ended prematurely due to bad light and the result had to be decided via the Duckworth-Lewis Method. The Zimbabweans enjoyed a slight advantage, with the last seven balls remaining, before bad light intervened. They were on 266/6 when play was stopped, and needed just eight runs from the remaining seven deliveries to complete the chase of South Africa A’s 273/7. The hosts won the toss and elected to field first. Andile Phehlukwayo top-scored with 87 runs and captain Heinrich Klaasen’s 58 saw the SA ‘A’ side post a competitive total in their 50 overs. Tony de Zorzi (28) and Theunis de Bruyn (32) combined for the first wicket partnership of 58 runs before the latter was caught behind by Richmond Mutumbami off the bowling of Donald Tiripano. But the South Africans found themselves four wickets down with 94 runs on the board following the dismissals of de Zorzi, Reeza Hendricks (22) and Khaya Zondo (7). Skipper Klaasen and Phehlukwayo then upped the tempo with a 136-run partnership for the fifth wicket.  Donald Tiripano shone with the ball for Zimbabwe after taking four wickets. His bowling was a bit expensive though, as he finished with 4-57 in his eight overs. Tendai Chatara had 2-39 while Raza had 1-47 in his 10 overs. The Zimbabwe XI side stumbled early in their chase after losing opener Takudzwanashe Kaitano for a golden duck with the first legitimate delivery of the innings, off the bowling of Lizaad Williams. The hosts remained resolute though, with Kevin Kasuza contributing 27 runs in the second wicket partnership with Prince Masvaure (49), who was disappointed to miss a half ton after becoming Williams’s second scalp of the day. Wesley Madhevere then chipped in with a quick-fire 34 from 27 balls. Raza, who is captaining the Zimbabwe XI, then led from the front with a brilliant 59 from 50 balls. The Zimbabwe all-rounder turned 36-years on Sunday. Milton Shumba was unbeaten on 45 when play was stopped due to bad light. Tiripano was also doing well with the bat on the other end with an unbeaten 24 from 19 as the match headed into the decisive over. Zimbabwe lead the three-match series 1-0, ahead of the second game tomorrow at the same venue. RESULT: South Africxa A 273/7 in 50 overs (Phehlukwayo 87, Klaasen 58; Tiripano 4/57, Chatara 2/39) lost to Zim XI 266/6 in 48.5 overs (Raza 59, Masvaure 49, Shumba 45*; Hendricks 2/24, Williams 2/29, Coetzee 1/43) by 5 runs (D/L method)

The Herald Oscar Rusenga in Triangle Triangle……………………………………………0 Highlanders………………………………………0 BULAWAYO giants Highlanders held Triangle to a goalless draw in a drab Castle Lager Premiership football match at Gibbo yesterday. The match started at a pedestrian pace but the visitors had a fair share of possession. Highlanders had early chances thwarted by Taurai Chitsumba and Devine Mhindirira’s shot in the 7th minute was parried for a corner before Peter Muduhwa’s header from the resultant corner was dealt with by an alert Triangle goalie. Stanley Ngala had a chance to score a minute later but his effort crashed against the upright as the scores remained level. The visitors, who had better chances in the first half, could not break the deadlock as Chitsumba made sure the scores remained the same. Gift Bhero was lively from the wings and created few opportunities in the opening half but Walter Sande skied his side’s first real chance on the cusp of half-time. Triangle captain and top goal scorer Donald Ngoma missed the home side’s big chance, missing a sitter from few yard out of Ariel Sibanda’s goal in the 71st minute. The match ended goalless as the two sides sharing spoils but the visiting coach Mandla Mpofu was disappointed with the result. “There is always a say that a point on the road is better but I might say today we lost two points. “Our intention was clear that we wanted to collect maximum points and we domitated from the opening exchanges. “We took control of the game from the onset and we dominated the midfield but it’s always not easy coming to Triangle, a side that is doing well in the league. “We take the point and some positives from the game as we prepare for our next game at home.” Triangle gaffer Jairos Tapera was not happy but felt the result was fair. “We came into this game expecting to win, we always want to collect maximum points at home but unfortunately we could not convert the few chances we created”, said Tapera.

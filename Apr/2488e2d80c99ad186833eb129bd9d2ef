The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga-Sports Reporter ZIMBABWEAN professional golfer Shaahid Mahmed still has a better chance of qualifying for a Sunshine Tour Card after he was the best-placed local at the on-going tournament at the Heron Banks Golf and River Estate in South Africa. Mamhed is tied on position 17 after he carded a level par with only three local professionals taking to the field. The former Chapman-based player also has Stuart Krog and Mark Williams in the field that will see the players playing four rounds with the top 10 getting the rights to play in the Sunshine Tour. Former Mississippi State University graduate Krog also had a decent outing after he carded a two-over-par as Williams’ hopes faded with a five-over-par to sit at a distant position 93. Mahmed has been trying his best taking part in several tournaments and his form has been improving with each passing tournament.

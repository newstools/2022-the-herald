It is undeniable that it has changed the narrative of people reliant on mainstream media due to its ability to engage social, economic and political issues in real time. “However, in incapable, irresponsible and unprofessional hands, social media can destabilize and even destroy social harmony and cohesion. It fuels voter apathy as it undermines democracy as well as individual and group rights. “Indeed political violence has been instigated by social media platforms peddling false narratives in many instances. Examples of such abuses and devastating consequences obtain here, and continent wide,” said Mr Kiwa. <img class="wp-image-613324 size-large" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Screenshot_20220422-161526_Gallery-680x383.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Screenshot_20220422-161526_Gallery-680x383.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Screenshot_20220422-161526_Gallery-360x203.jpg 360w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Screenshot_20220422-161526_Gallery-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Screenshot_20220422-161526_Gallery.jpg 1078w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Social media practitioners follow proceedings at the ZEC social media workshop, today.

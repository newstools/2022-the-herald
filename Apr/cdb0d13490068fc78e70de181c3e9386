The Herald LONDON. – British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has apologised after being fined by the Met Police for breaking lockdown rules but said he would not resign. The prime minister said: “I have paid the fine and I once again offer a full apology.” Asked if he would quit over the fine, Mr Johnson said: “I want to be able to get on and deliver the mandate that I have, but also to tackle the problems that the country must face right now.” Pressed on whether the fact he had broken his own laws meant that was not possible, he responded: “I believe that it’s my job to get on and deliver for the people of this country and that is what I’m going to do.” Discussing how he had been fined for attending his own birthday party in the Cabinet room in Downing Street in June 2020, the prime minister said “in all frankness at that time it did not occur to me that this might have been a breach of the rules”. But he said after being issued a fine he “now humbly accepts” he did breach Covid-19 laws. Mr Johnson, his wife Carrie and Chancellor Rishi Sunak were notified they would be issued with fines for breaking lockdown rules. They are all understood to have paid £50 each, a reduced rate as the fixed penalty notices were settled within 14 days. In a statement Mr Sunak offered an “unreserved apology” and signalled he would not resign. He said: “I understand that for figures in public office, the rules must be applied stringently in order to maintain public confidence. I respect the decision that has been made and have paid the fine.” – Skynews

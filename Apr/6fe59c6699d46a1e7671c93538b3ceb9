As most of you are aware, I arrived in the country recently, presented my credentials to His Excellency the President and I am having meetings to have a better appreciation of the work and support that have been provided by the UN to Zimbabwe. Our discussions today acknowledged the long standing cooperation between the UN system and Parliament of Zimbabwe,” said Mr Kallon. “Of critical importance to Zimbabwe in our discussions were some of the Bills that have been passed by Parliament, like the Marriage law, which we think is a very important Bill.

It means we clean every day. This is a campaign to make sure that all the citizens in this country, at least make sure that their houses and neighbourhoods are clean. Cleanliness is next to godliness.   “We are thankful to Transmedia, which is our signal company which identified this area as one of the potential areas which we need to keep clean. We are quite happy because we managed to clean a lot of stuff.” Zimpapers group chief executive Mr Pikirayi Deketeke said it was important to identify with the things that are of concern to society. <img class="size-full wp-image-609523" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/WhatsApp-Image-2022-04-01-at-1.42.50-PM.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/WhatsApp-Image-2022-04-01-at-1.42.50-PM.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/WhatsApp-Image-2022-04-01-at-1.42.50-PM-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimpapers Chief Executive Officer Mr Pikirayi Deketeke (second from left) leads the Media House’s employees at a clean-up at Glen Roy Shopping centre in Highlands, Harare – Picture: Kudakwashe Hunda “What is important is we are licensed to serve and we are not just licensed to publish information but also to be part of the society that we live in,” he said. “Today we are joining the team here at Zinara headquarters even though we have our own programme that is trying to make sure that First Street, which is one of our iconic streets in Harare, is swept and kept clean. “We have placed bins along George Silundika Avenue (in the central business district) as our contribution towards the cleanliness of our city. We want to be practical as well as disseminate information to our communities.”

The Herald BELGRADE. — Novak Djokovic said on Monday that he is aiming to be “as ready as I can be” for Roland Garros as he prepares for just his third tennis tournament of the season in Belgrade this week. The world No. 1 was deported from Australia ahead of the Australian Open in January over his Covid vaccination status, before also missing Indian Wells and the Miami Open in the United States. In the Serbian star’s absence, Rafael Nadal won a record 21st Grand Slam singles title in Melbourne, moving out of a tie with Djokovic and Roger Federer. Djokovic will be hoping to match his great rival’s tally at Roland Garros, which begins on May 22. “Roland Garros is the quintessential clay-court tournament and I’m partly already there in my thoughts, in terms of preparation and everything I’m doing at the moment to get there as ready as I can be,” Djokovic told reporters in Belgrade. The 34-year-old also said he was planning to play in the Madrid Masters and the Italian Open ahead of Roland Garros. “My current plans include Madrid and Rome,” he added. “It depends, really, on my result here and the shape I’m in. We’ll decide then.” — AFP

The Herald MADRID. — Karim Benzema and Joao Felix ensured Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid claimed morale-boosting victories in the Spanish La Liga on Saturday before facing the English Premier League football’s heavyweights this week in the Champions League quarter-finals. Benzema missed one penalty but scored two as Real Madrid defeated Celta Vigo 2-1 to get back to winning ways ahead of Wednesday’s crunch meeting with Chelsea. And Atletico Madrid sailed past Alaves 4-1 before their trip to Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City tomorrow, the in-form Felix scoring twice, with Luis Suarez adding a brace of his own after coming on as a substitute. Felix now has seven goals in his last eight games for Atletico and the 22-year-old is likely to be key if Diego Simeone’s men are to spring a surprise against City and reach the semi-finals. Madrid’s victory at Balaidos will calm any nerves in La Liga’s title race too, allowing the leaders to draw a line under their thrashing at the hands of a resurgent Barcelona before the international break. And, despite an imperfect performance, the win should restore confidence ahead of the first leg away at Chelsea, with Thomas Tuchel’s side now recovering from a humiliation of their own, after they were earlier thumped 4-1 at home by Brentford. Chelsea, who outplayed Real Madrid over two semi-final legs last year, will be a much sterner test than Celta and Carlo Ancelotti’s side will almost certainly not have the benefit of being awarded three penalties at Stamford Bridge. Thibaut Courtois was also called upon again to make some excellent saves to deny Celta a draw. “I think we deserved more today but Courtois is the best goalkeeper out there,” said Celta captain Iago Aspas. — AFP.

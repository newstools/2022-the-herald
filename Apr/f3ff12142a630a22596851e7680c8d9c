The Herald Freedom Mupanedemo-Midlands Bureau A CCC councillor has been arrested for assaulting a neighbour who had his debt. Cllr Leadmore Mtembedzi (41) of Ward 3 in Gokwe was restrained by his wife from further assaulting Mr Mike Tarusarira whom he accused of rudely demanding his money. Mtembedzi of number 6750 Njelele stands was yesterday before Gokwe magistrate Mr Hillary Ndlovu facing charges of assaulting Mr Tarusarisa and was remanded to Thursday 26 May on $5000 bail. The State case against Mtembedzi was that on Tuesday this week, Mr Tarusarira approached him and demanded his money. The court heard that Mtembedzi responded rudely but Mr Tarusarira reprimanded him and told him that since he was a councillor he should instead lead by example in paying back debts. This did not go down well with Mtembedzi who then charged at Mr Tarusarira before punching him. Mtembedzi was stopped by his wife and a neighbour from further assaulting Mr Tarusarira. The court heard that Mr Tarusarira who sustained injuries on the privates and right side of the neck due to the assault, went and sought medication at Gokwe District Hospital. The matter was then reported to the police leading to Mtembedzi’s arrest. Miss Getrude Shoko appeared for the State.

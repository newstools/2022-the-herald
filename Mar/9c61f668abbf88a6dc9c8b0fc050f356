The Herald LONDON. — Arsenal are reportedly interested in signing Robert Lewandowski as the star’s future remains up in the air. The 33-year-old Polish striker has less than 18 months left on his deal at German Bundesliga football champions Bayern Munich. He could leave for nothing in June 2023 or, if the Bundesliga giants decide to cash in, possibly go this summer. That has led to a number of clubs beginning to circle — and now Arsenal have apparently joined the chase. That is according to Four Four Two, who state the Gunners are interested in bringing him to the Emirates. Mikel Arteta is desperate to add attacking reinforcements to his squad with both Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah out of contract in June. However, any potential move for Lewandowski would likely depend on whether they qualified for the Champions League. And they would face fierce competition for his signature as Atletico Madrid became the latest team linked with a swoop on Tuesday. — The Sun

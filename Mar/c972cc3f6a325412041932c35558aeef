While his passing on maybe particularly felt by you, his fellow countrymen and women for whom he worked so hard with distinction, the people of Zimbabwe also honour his legacy and mourn his loss alongside yourself.” In Zimbabwe, President Mnangagwa said, former President Banda was being remembered as someone who fought against illegal sanctions imposed by the West. Former President Banda understood that Zambia could not be an island of peace and prosperity if its neighbours like Zimbabwe still battled with instability under Western sanctions, said President Mnangagwa. “He was indeed dedicated to the beliefs that as members of this great African continent we must develop together with our neighbours and share a prosperous future,” he said. “The late former President’s fame and unequivocal call for the unconditional removal of the illegal and unilateral sanctions imposed by some Western countries on Zimbabwe will always be honoured and cherished by the people of Zimbabwe.” <img class="size-medium wp-image-606964" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Banda-funeral3-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="201" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Banda-funeral3-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Banda-funeral3.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> Pallbearers carry the casket bearing the body of former Zambia President Rupiah Banda during the State funeral at Lusaka Showgrounds yesterday. President Mnangagwa said former President Banda’s “astute leadership will remain a source of inspiration and encouragement to all of us”. “I remember in the early 60s when we were in the youth league of UNIP (United National Independence Party of Zambia), under Dingiswayo Banda, I learnt that my dear brother Rupiah was so humble, but his sophistication was embedded in that simplicity,” he said. “We will forever cherish the extra ordinary life of this remarkable statesman who devoted his life to serving Zambia, our region and the African continent.” President Mnangagwa said former President Banda was a pan-Africanist and “among the rare breed of leaders in our region”. “We pay enormous tribute to his active role in the politics and advancing the social economic development of our people, dating back to his days as a member of the United National Independence Party,” he said. “It was UNIP which played an instrumental role in independence and decolonisation of Southern Africa, including Zimbabwe. We also treasurer and revere the late former President Banda for the vast knowledge and experience you shared with many of us in the region with regards international relations and economic development.” <img class="size-medium wp-image-606965" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Banda-funeral2-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="201" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Banda-funeral2-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Banda-funeral2.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> President Mnangagwa chats to former Zambian leader Edgar Lungu and incumbent President Hakainde Hichilema in Zambia yesterday. President Mnangagwa said former President Banda’s rich legacy of selflessness and dedication to one’s country should be cherished. “Very few of you are privileged to know that the late former President Rupiah Banda played a significant role behind the curtains in the transition from my learned brother Edgar Lungu to my brother-in-law Hichilema,” he said. “He knew no region, gender, age and class. He was a man of the people and an embodiment of Africa’s spirit of Ubuntu. These are traits that must be emulated as we continue in our quest to build the Africa we all want.” President Mnangagwa said the passing on of former President Banda during Zambia’s National Youth Day should serve as a constant reminder to the young people in the region of the importance of serving one’s country, taking pride in it and advancing its development and prosperity for the people. “On behalf of the Government and people of Zimbabwe, and indeed on my own behalf, I express my deepest condolences to you Your Excellency and dear brother President Hakainde Hichilema, the bereaved Banda family and the people of Zambia on the untimely passing on of the 4th president of this great nation,” said President Mnangagwa. “My dear brother Rupiah, go well son of Africa, go well son of the soil, go well revolutionary, go well a unifier. May your dear soul former President Rupiah Banda rest in eternal peace.” Also addressing the mourners, President Hichilema urged youths to learn from Africa’s founding generation. “The founding generation is depleting,” he said. “The younger generation can only learn from this generation that endured. “For us as the leaders and to the young people, there can never be any better way of celebrating than embrace peace, unity, love and patriotism that he stood for, and make sure those values are ours.” President Hichilema thanked the leaders who travelled for the State funeral, saying their gesture was a sign of oneness, regional unity and continental unity. <img class="size-medium wp-image-606967" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Banda-funeral-4-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="201" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Banda-funeral-4-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Banda-funeral-4.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> President Mnangagwa and other leaders join mourners at the State funeral in Zambia yesterday. – Pictures: Tawanda Mudimu.

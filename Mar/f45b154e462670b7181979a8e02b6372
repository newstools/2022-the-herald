The Herald Huawei Technologies said it will ensure that half of its workers in South Africa are citizens of the continent’s most developed economy in three years, ending a spat with President Cyril Ramaphosa’s government, which has been battling an unemployment rate that’s among the world’s highest. The South Africa government opened a case against the Chinese tech giant in February for exceeding the number of foreigners it’s allowed to employ in the country. Expatriate workers made up 90 percent of Huawei’s employees in the nation, making it a target for the administration that has increased its rhetoric against immigrants filling local jobs. Huawei will also invest in training unskilled and unemployed youth in the country, the two parties said in a joint statement yesterday. The Chinese technology firm employs almost 1 000 people in the nation. South Africa’s ruling African National Congress has been cracking down on immigration since losing a large chunk of support in Johannesburg and Pretoria in last year’s local elections, casting doubt over the party’s ability to maintain a long-held national majority in 2024. —  Bloomberg.

The Herald Nyore Madzianike Senior Court Reporter HARARE regional magistrate Mr Ngoni Nduna today cleared former Cabinet Minister Prisca Mupfumira of allegations of subverting National Social Security Authority (NSSA) tender processes and pressuring the authority’s management to fast-track the construction of low-income housing units in Gweru, but ruled that she be put to her defence case to explain how the construction firm, Drawcard Enterprises, which undertook the project came aboard. Mr Nduna also acquitted Barnabas Matongera, who was jointly charged with Mupfumira of the offence saying he played no role in the decision towards the construction of the low-cost housing units in Gweru. Mupfumira and Matongera were charged with criminal abuse of office. In his ruling on Mupfumira and Matongera’s application for discharge at the close of the State case, Mr Nduna said the State failed to lead evidence that proved that the duo instigated the resolution to undertake the Gweru projects. Mupfumira is expected back in court on April 25 for her defence case. Mr Whisper Mabhaudhi and Mr Lovemore Masuku appeared for the State.

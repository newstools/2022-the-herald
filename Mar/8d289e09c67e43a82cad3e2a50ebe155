The Herald Eddie Chikamhi-Senior Sports Reporter HARARE City coach Taurai Mangwiro wants to see a change of fortunes in front of goal when the Sunshine Boys host Dynamos in a Castle Lager Premiership football match at the National Sports Stadium tomorrow. The municipality side have not been clinical in the final third, with only six goals to show for their toils in the opening eight matches of the campaign. Statistics show they have not scored in five of the matches. Ironically, the Sunshine Boys recently lost one of their top marksmen William Manondo, who has already pumped in half-a-dozen goals in five outings for giants CAPS United. But after taking his side through the thorough drilling in the last few weeks, Mangwiro is desperate to see the changes. Last weekend they scored twice in the 2-1 away win over Bulawayo Chiefs and they are hoping to build on the positive result. Mangwiro, however, will not throw caution to the wind against a DeMbare side that has been enjoying a fine run after winning their last three games in succession. “We are quite aware of the form that Dynamos are in at the moment and for us to get something out of this match, we would need to be at our best. We need to attack well and defend well. “As a professional football team, we respect Dynamos for what they are but we have no fear of them whatsoever. Of course, I am impressed by the work that Tonderai Ndiraya has been doing with the team. “But for us to continue with our resurgence, we have been reminding the players to put in extra work. Every game is a new challenge so we have to continue working hard to change the fortunes of the team in front of goal. “If we are to look at the last few games that we have played, the team has been doing well but it’s the conversion that has been letting us down. “So there have been a lot of drills at training, the players have been exposed to a variety of situations, we have been trying combinations and we hope to see the results,” said Mangwiro. <img class="size-full wp-image-453117" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/0910-1-1-MANGWIRO.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/0910-1-1-MANGWIRO.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/0910-1-1-MANGWIRO-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Taurai Mangwiro Harare City have been inconsistent and are currently in 10th place in the log standings with 10 points from eight starts. Dynamos on the other hand have been in cruising mode after notching up three wins on the trot. Dynamos coach Ndiraya also sounded cautious of his opposite number Mangwiro, who is a tactically sound gaffer. “We are playing a good side because of the coach who is leading that team, they’re organised and have a good coach in Taurai Mangwiro. “We are expecting a team which is very organized and, tactically, which is very astute. It’s going to be a difficult match but one which we hope we can get a result because we’ve got a target. “We’ve been doing well in the previous matches and we hope we can get the result that we want. It gets more difficult as you win more matches,” said Ndiraya. DeMbare are coming from a 2-0 win over ZPC Kariba. They have won their last three games in succession to maintain pressure on log leaders Chicken Inn. They are currently third with 16 points, three behind the leaders. “I think it’s a good direction that we are taking, it’s a good trajectory if I may put it that way. “But these are early days, we are not reading much into that. What we are reading much into is the consistency in which we have had in the past three matches and I hope that we can continue on that. “We know what we want and if we keep moving in the trajectory we’ve been, we have a chance of getting to the top. “But that is not going to be easy, we are not alone in this, we are playing as a team and playing very well. “If you look at the log we are separated by a few points with the top teams. It shows how stiff the competition is at the moment. But we are confident, we have a good team. We have worked hard in the last three games and we will work hard together so that we get to the end,” said Ndiraya. DeMbare, however, will miss skipper Partson Jaure who is recovering from a back injury, defensive linkman Keith Murera and possibly Frank Makarati, who is struggling with an ankle knock. Harare City, on the other hand, will go into the match without midfield lieutenant Donald Mudadi who is serving suspension.

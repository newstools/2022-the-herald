The Herald Kanye ‘Ye’ West has added Trevor Noah to his list of enemies. Yesterday, the American rapper lashed out at the South African-born comedian, with a racial slur on Instagram. Ye’s outburst comes after Noah addressed the rapper’s highly publicised divorce from Kim Kardashian during an episode of The Daily Show. In the video, Noah unpacks the ongoing feud between West, Kardashian and her current boyfriend, Pete Davidson. “The Daily Show” host discusses everything from West’s disturbing music video for Eazy, in which a claymation Ye kidnaps a claymation of Davidson and buries him alive, to Pete’s text messages in which he claims to be in bed with Ye’s “wife”. Furthermore Noah points out “the harassment many women face when trying to leave a relationship,” by highlighting West’s recent actions. “Over time, Kanye has become more and more belligerent in how he tries to get Kim back,” Noah said. Elsewhere in the video, Noah acknowledged that it’s fair to think Kardashian needs publicity for her new reality TV show; however, the fact remains that West is harassing her. “Two things can be true: Kim likes publicity. Kim is also being harassed. Those things can be happening at the same time.” Noah ended his video by asking the question: “If Kim cannot escape this, Kim Kardashian. If she cannot escape this, then what chance do normal women have?”—  Channel24

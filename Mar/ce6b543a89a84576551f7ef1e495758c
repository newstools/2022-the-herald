ALLIANCE Health Eagles Women maintained a perfect run at the end of the first round matches of the domestic cricket Fifty50 Challenge when they beat Mountaineers Women by 26 runs at Old Hararians Sports Club yesterday. The victory, which was decided via the Duckworth-Lewis Method, cemented their place on top of the log table with 14 points from three wins in as many games. Precious Marange (48) and skipper Modester Mupachikwa (35), who was playing in her first game in the competition, ensured Eagles Women reached a competitive score as they were bowled out for 187 in 45 overs. The target was revised to 154 in 37 overs because of bad weather but Mountaineers Women could only manage 127-6 in those 37 overs as they slumped to a third straight defeat in the competition. In another match played at Sunrise Sports Club, Rhinos Women posted an impressive eight-wicket victory over Tuskers Women to end the first round in second place. Ashley Ndiraya was in mean mood with the ball after taking 4-22 as Tuskers were bowled out for 121 all in 31.1 overs. Rhinos Women skipper Josephine Nkomo, who had earlier taken two wickets, led the chase with an unbeaten 54, which included two fours, off 126 deliveries. Rhinos Women were still all good at 122-2 after gobbling 43.2 overs. Scorecards:

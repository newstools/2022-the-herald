The Herald LONDON. — Everton are teetering on the edge of disaster following news that they could face a points deduction for breaking English Premier League football finance regulations. The Toffees are just a point above the relegation zone and their top-flight status is hanging in the balance for the first time in over two decades. Frank Lampard’s side are facing an almighty battle to stay afloat ahead of a nightmarish run-in, but problems off the field are just as troubling as problems on it, it seems. Everton are yet to publish their financial accounts for the 2020/21 season, but are expected to record losses of over £100m. This could have potential disastrous consequences given that the club recorded combined losses of over £260m between 2017 and 2020, which in ordinary circumstances would represent a clear breach of Premier League rules — The Daily Star

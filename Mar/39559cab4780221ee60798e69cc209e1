The Herald Grace Mahora and Lesego Valela Visiting Jamaican recording artiste Neelah said she is happy with Zimbabwe’s loving and welcoming people. The musician, who is part of the line-up for the JamAfro Festival scheduled to take place this Saturday at Alexandra Sports Club, arrived yesterday afternoon. She is going to share the stage with energetic South African artiste Makhadzi, Freeman, Nutty O, Sulumani Chimbetu and Mr Brown among others. “Zimbabwe is a peaceful country and I am loving it,” said Neelah. “It is wonderful and I feel good. This Saturday expect a great performance.” Neelah last year said she was eyeing an African and the United Kingdom tour where she says her music has been well-received. “The style of music that I do is marketable in those regions and with all restrictions here, it was a tactical move to branch out and have my music promoted overseas,” she said. Neelah, who is a fresh face and voice in the dancehall genre, said music was not just her passion, but an obsession. Born Cornelia Abarus in the Clarendon parish of Jamaica, but later grew up in the Jamaican capital Kingston, Neelah said given a chance in Zimbabwe, she wanted to try her hand at collaborating with local artistes like Freeman. In an interview with The Herald Arts, one of the festival promoters, Boniface Jana, said all was set for the show. “Neelah has arrived, though she was delayed, but we are happy everything is going according to plan,” he said. The stage is set and we are expecting a huge turnout. “The show will be hosted under the Covid-19 guidelines and regulations.” Jana said Makhadzi will arrive tomorrow. “We are expecting Makhadzi this Friday (tomorrow),” he said. “She is having a private show this Friday in South Africa before she comes to Zimbabwe. All our local artistes have confirmed their participation and rehearsals are in progress. The event will start in the afternoon and ends around 10pm.”

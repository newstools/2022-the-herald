The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — South African football champions Mamelodi Sundowns have qualified for the CAF Champions League quarter-finals after they beat Al Ahly 1-0 in a Group A clash at the FNB Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Peter Shalulile scored the only goal of the game in the 23rd minute to put the Brazilians in command of their group, having collected 10 points from four matches, with the Red Eagles trailing them by six points in second place. Pitso Mosimane’s side dominated possession without creating too many chances as Sundowns looked to pick them off. The hosts had the first sniff at goal on nine minutes when Mothobi Mvala warmed the gloves of Mohamed El Shenawy with a strike from the edge of the area. They threatened again seven minutes later as Haashim Domingo met Lyle Lakay’s cross at the back post to fire over the crossbar. Percy Tau — back at his old stomping ground — then tested Kennedy Mweene with an effort from range on 20 minutes, but Masandawana would be celebrating the lead just three minutes later. Shalulile was well placed to tap home at the back the post after the defence failed to deal with a corner. The Namibian almost grabbed his second goal of the game on 28 minutes, although he wasn’t able to keep his shot down after connecting with Lakay’s cross. — Spersport.com

The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter Herentals………………………………………….. (1) 2 Simba Bhora……………………………………….(0) 0 HERENTALS Under-20 finally burst the Simba Bhora bubble with a convincing victory in a ZIFA Northern Region Division One Soccer League match at Morris Depot yesterday. The much-anticipated top-of-the-table clash saw the Students outplaying the Shamva-based outfit whose defence was at fault for both goals. Herentals Under-20 got their first goal through Silas Azeti in the 32nd minute. Simba sought to come back into the game with Tinashe Balakasi twice forcing excellent saves from Nevermind Antonio, in goals for Herentals Under-20. After the breather, Simba Bhora, who came back a more purposeful side, were caught on a counter by substitute Salif Cheya who scored the Students’ second goal. Herentals coach Paul Benza was happy with the win and is hopeful to continue getting the points. “I am very happy with the progress so far, especially the progress the team has been doing. The youngsters are playing so well and they are showing a lot of energy. I had seen it coming considering that we were playing against an aged team that has a lot of old players,” said Benza. Simba Bhora coach Arthur Tutani wished Herentals Under-20 all the best as he blamed centre referee Bhachi Kandure for some questionable decisions. ‘’Despite the team not doing enough in the first half they were punished. I am very happy for Herentals Under-20 for a good game and wish them well as they march towards the championship. “It was a good game and the better team of the day won,” said Tutani.

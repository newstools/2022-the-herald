The Herald THERE is a slight possibility that the Warriors can still take part in the upcoming African Cup of Nations 2023 football qualifiers, it has emerged. The next edition of the continental show-piece is scheduled for next year in Cote d’Ivoire but Zimbabwe was sanctioned by FIFA from taking part in any international tournaments until the suspended Felton Kamambo-led ZIFA board is reinstated. The Sports Commission have been defiant in insisting that Kamambo and company will not be reinstated, but the Gerald Mlotshwa-led sports regulatory body has given a green light for there to be a ZIFA emergency general meeting. Kamambo and company were given up to April 3 to conduct the Emergency General Meeting, failure to which the ZIFA councillors can have it on their behalf. Well-placed sources say even the SRC is looking forward that watershed meeting, for it to possibly define the future of Zimbabwean football. The Afcon qualifiers start in May, meaning if the house is put in order, the Warriors can still be in the group stages for the continental extravaganza. — Soccer24

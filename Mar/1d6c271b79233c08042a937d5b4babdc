The Herald LONDON. — Cristiano Ronaldo will kiss goodbye to £5million because of Manchester United’s season from hell. Ronaldo returned to Old Trafford last summer on a heavily bonus-related contract to offset a hefty drop in his £750 000-a-week salary at Juventus. But United will finish without a trophy for a FIFTH successive season —  blowing away most of those incentives. The heftiest was the  Champions League last-16 defeat to Atletico Madrid, which would have earned Ronaldo about £2.5m had they reached the final in Paris in May. Winning a first English Premier League title since 2013 was also worth up to £1.5m. Failure in both domestic cup competitions was another boot in the wallet for the five-time Ballon d’Or winner. Missing next season’s Champions League would also be a huge blow to Ronaldo, whose basic pay is around half the amount he earned in Italy. Ronaldo (37) will still trigger a sizeable bonus if he is United’s top scorer and only fellow Portugal star Bruno Fernandes is in touching distance. — The Sun.

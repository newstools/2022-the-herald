The Herald AUGUSTA. — Tiger Woods has prompted speculation he will return to competitive action at next week’s Masters golf tournament by completing a practice round at Augusta. Woods appears to be closing in on a sensational comeback at the Masters next week after turning up at Augusta National with his son Charlie on Tuesday for a practice round. The 15-time major champion has not played in a tour event since his near-fatal car accident in Los Angeles more than a year ago, resulting in horrific injuries to his right leg. He played down his chances of competing at Augusta last month, declaring that he had only played some holes while riding in a buggy. But Woods has been spotted walking 18 holes on a couple of occasions over the past week in Florida and the speculation regarding his return increased when his name remained on the list of ‘active competitors’ on the Masters website. He played an afternoon practice round on Tuesday that clearly represents a late fitness test. Augusta is a severely undulating course, so it makes sense for Woods to see how his leg reacts to playing shots from uneven lies and walking more than 7,500 yards. There is no deadline for Woods to commit to the Masters, meaning he could leave it until as late as another week before making a final decision. The last time Woods was seen in proper competition was the 2020 Masters, when he was the defending champion following the most stupendous of his five victories in 2019. Now the golf world will be holding its breath and hoping against the odds that we are about to witness another Tiger miracle at the Masters. He has looked to wave away expectations in recent weeks, however, after he revealed at the Genesis Open that he cannot walk on a course with “undulations’’. Due to the layout at Augusta, there has been little hope that Woods would mount a memorable charge for what would be a record-equalling sixth green jacket. — BBC Sport.

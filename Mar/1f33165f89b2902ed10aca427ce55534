The Herald Mukudzei Chingwere Herald Reporter Ireland is looking at partnering Zimbabwe in agricultural collaboration, Ireland Ambassador to Zimbabwe Fionnuala Gilsenan has said. She made the remarks after paying a courtesy call on Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Ambassador Frederick Shava recently. President Mnangagwa has already given indication that agriculture, mining and other sectors will form the bedrock on which the vision of an upper middle income society by 2030 will be built. Ambassador Gilsenan said they are already collaborating with Zimbabwe in other sectors and will be looking at accelerating agricultural interchange. “We were discussing the recent AU-EU summit the Minister attended in Brussels and we were just talking about some of the areas they engaged in when they were there. “Our Prime Minister co-chaired a round table on agriculture and food systems and the Minister was saying he attended that and found it really useful,” said Ambassador Gilsenan. “We are collaborating in a lot of areas already. We are collaborating in the health sector, so we were talking about collaboration around agriculture particularly and looking at possibilities of trade between Zimbabwe and Ireland.” She said the idea is to develop a rounded relationship between the two republics. Agricultural production is a key driver of the Irish economy and they have done well particularly in livestock production, an area Zimbabwe is looking at boosting under its agricultural transformation.

The Herald NAIROBI. – Following a significant decline in the number of new Covid-19 cases since January, many African countries have relaxed restrictions, with some even lifting the remaining ones. However, experts are calling for caution in the easing of restrictions, noting the pandemic is not yet over and the vaccination rate in the continent still remains low. John Nkengasong, the director of Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, urged African governments to continue promoting health measures as well as increase vaccination rates even as they ease restrictions. “We are not yet out of the woods. Over the last two years, we have gone through a series of waves so let’s not be deceived because we have seen a low transmission season,” Nkengasong said. He warned the lifting of restrictions may also lead to re-infection as has been the case in Europe and other parts of the world. Nkengasong added Africa CDC is not encouraging any country to massively lift restrictions. – ChinaDaily.com

The Herald MELBOURNE. — Shane Warne will be publicly farewelled at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, home to many of his greatest sports moments, later this month. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews has confirmed the MCG as the venue for a state memorial service on March 30 to honour the Australian cricket legend, who died suddenly due to heart attack in Thailand last week. “There’s nowhere in the world more appropriate to farewell Warnie than the ‘G,” Andrews tweeted on Wednesday. The MCG was the stage of the legspinner’s famous Ashes hat-trick in 1994 and the 700th Test wicket on Boxing Day in 2006, his final series before he retired from international cricket. Ticket information for the evening event is yet to be released, but the premier said there will be no crowd cap at the venue, which can hold up to 100 000 spectators. — Cricinfo

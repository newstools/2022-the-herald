The Herald Danai Chitakasha-Special Correspondent A LOT of good midfielders have graced the Zimbabwean football terrain. While their individual performances have left us with unforgettable memories, coaches usually look for combinations which work to help the team. Such combinations have been discussed before by veteran football commentator Charles “CNN’’ Mabika, but allow me to add some more in this contribution. I will revisit briefly the most popular ones among the fans but my focus will be on the less well-known but which were equally effective. The combination of Stanford “Stix” Mutizwa and Joel “Jubilee” Shambo is universally accepted as one of the best to emerge from our football fraternity.  <img class="size-full wp-image-488353" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/05/STIX-SAINTS.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/05/STIX-SAINTS.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/05/STIX-SAINTS-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> THE MAGICIAN AT WORK . . . Former Black Rhinos midfield maestro Stanford “Stix” Mutizwa (centre) has the ball firmly under his control as he is surrounded by a number of Zimbabwe Saints players, who include (from right) Misheck “Roadblock” Sibanda, Andrew “Mai Maria” Kadengu and Ephraim “Rock of Gibraltar” Chawanda, during a league match at Barbourfields in the mid-1980s. When I started watching football in 1981, this combination was at its peak. I fell in love with the dynamism of this duo and I became a keen follower of CAPS United. The formation of Black Rhinos in 1983, disrupted this combination. CAPS United had to rebuild and in came Anthony Kambani to play at the base of midfield with Shambo now playing a more advanced role. In the mix was also the energetic Oscar Motsi, nicknamed “ Simbimbino” and that turned out to be a very effective combination. It’s such a shame that Edwin Farai, a man whose passing of the ball was once compared to that of Archieford “Chehuchi’’ Chimutanda by none other than legendary coach Obediah “Wasu” Sarupinda, had his career cut short by injury. I wonder what could have happened had Farai stayed fit! Along their football journey, CAPS United fans have been spoiled by good midfield combinations which emerged over the years. When Shambo retired, the man who became the main conductor and fulcrum of that midfield department was Joe “Kode” Mugabe. Many combinations revolved around him. In 1996, CAPS United ruthlessly marched towards their first league title after Independence. In midfield, they had the tough tackling Lloyd Chitembwe and the eye pleasing “Mr Perfect” Farai Mbidzo, what a combination that was.  It is important to highlight that ‘’Kode from Mabvuku’’ combined well also with Cheche Billiat who used to be the enforcer, allowing the former to do the damage with his box to box runs. What about “Yogo Yogo”, Blessing Makunike? What about Basil Chisopo? Cruel death and injury robbed us of these two midfield maestros! Dynamos also had a number of some good combinations. One of the best was that of David “Yogi” Mandigora, Kuda “MaBla’’ Muchemeyi and Hamid “Muzukuru’’ Dhana. When Dhana left to join newly-formed Black Rhinos, Kenneth Jere came to the fore and filled the gap seamlessly. Soon he earned himself the nickname “Computer” from the Blue Army. I loved Jere, what a player he was with his trademark full circle turn before releasing the ball.  Later, Dynamos had Memory ‘’Muendamberi’’ Mucherahowa, Clayton Munemo and Biggie “Bindura’’ Zuze with Moses ‘’Bambo’’ Chunga playing as a wing-cum-midfielder. <img class="size-full wp-image-608492" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Moses-Chunga.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Moses-Chunga.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Moses-Chunga-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> LEGENDARY CROWD PULLERS . . . In the early 1980s local football fans used to flock to Rufaro Stadium in their thousands to watch supremely talented players such as (from left) Dynamos’ star players Moses “Bambo’’ Chunga and David ‘’Yogi’’ Mandigora; and Arcadia United’s Joey “Mafero’’ Antipas. This was an awesome combination which dazzled opponents at will. In a discussion with Mucherahowa, he also lauded his combination with Hope Chihota and Farai Chigama. This might come as a surprise for many because it was an unheralded one but the former DeMbare captain defended his choice. “I liked the two boys, Hope and Farai, because they allowed me a free role. They were both good ball winners and disrupted opponents so this allowed me to shine,” he said. This is how combinations work; you play to each other’s strengths. We all know about the Titus Majola and Willard “Mahwiii’’ Mashinkila-Khumalo  combination at Highlanders  and  Ernest “Mapepa’’ Sibanda, Majola and Tymon Mabaleka again at Highlanders, Rodrick Simwanza and Skeva Phiri at Hwange, William Sibanda and Max “Shaluza” Tshuma at Zimbabwe Saints, Obey Sova, Chemi Hunidzarira, Misheck “Roadblock’’ Sibanda and Jimmy Phiri at Zimbabwe Saints, Danny “DJ’’ Jambo, David Zulu and Kambani at Arcadia United, Dhana, Mutizwa and Langton “Govender’’ Mutimba at Black Rhinos and many others which are often highlighted in football discussions. To make the discussion more interesting, I sought the views of a number of legends. I asked them which combinations they enjoyed playing in and which ones they admired from various teams. Here is what they had to say. 1. Gary Mkandawire, the Chapungu United legend, said: “I enjoyed playing alongside Beaven Gwamure, Nonhlahla “Boxer” Moyo and Kennedy Chihuri.  I grew up admiring the combination of William Sibanda, Max ‘Shaluza’ Tshuma and Andrew “Mai Maria” Kadengu.  The first rate has to be the Shambo and Stix Mutizwa axis!” 2. Cephas “Mai Chisamba” Chimedza had this to say: “The best combination I played in was with Leo Kurauzvione, Andrew Chifamba, Francis Chandida and Eddie Mashiri at Dynamos. At CAPS United I played with Lloyd Chitembwe, Ashley Rambanepasi and Ian Bakala. “During my time, Highlanders had the best combination of Blessing Gumiso, Charles ‘Chief’ Chilufya, Johannes ‘Signature’ Ngodzo, Honour Gombani and Richard ‘Dabuka’ Choruma. That was a machine.  Amazulu was also well-served by Esrom Nyandoro, Thomas Banda, Ronald ‘Gidiza’ Sibanda, Ferdinand Mwachindalo and Vusa Nyoni. “At Black Rhinos, the combination of Menard Mupera, Lazarus Muhoni, Gift ‘Guava’ Kamuriwo and Max Ruza was not bad. Later they had Brighton Chandisaita and that made them solid.  I should not forget Isaac Nyabvure, Justice Majabvi and Petros ‘Gala’ Sibanda at Lanchashire Steel.’’ Wow, these are great players mentioned here by the legend. 3. Maxwell Dube, the man we all knew as “Marhino”, chipped in: “I enjoyed playing with Tapiwa Khumbuyani and Brian Zingwe. I would play as a utility player with a free role in front of the two.  I liked them because they were no-nonsense type of players. In one match against Dynamos, Leo Kurauzvione came to me to complain about the tackles. Leo was a hardman himself but on this day he met his match. Kumbuyani overheard Leo complaining and just laughed and said, ‘hatimire kusvika mabuda ropa!’ It was a proper battle when these two were in the team. The combination I admired the most was at Highlanders with Johannes Ngodzo, Gift Lunga, Mkhupali Masuku, Thulani Ncube and Dazzy Kapenya, they used the 3-5-2 formation. We would spend three quarters of the game chasing shadows.  I can say during my era, Bosso had the best combination!” 4. Douglas Zimbango, the much travelled player who played for home-town team Masvingo United, Highlanders and Buffaloes gave me his thoughts: “At Masvingo, there was Ferdinand Mwachinalo, Isaac Banda, Wonder Sithole and myself. We used a 4-4-2 formation with Mwachindalo and Banda in the middle, Sithole and myself on the flanks. It was an awesome combination and we really enjoyed ourselves.  At Bosso we had Mkhupali Masuku, Steven Alimenda, Richard Choruma, Ngodzo and Honour Gombami.  I also admired the 2004 CAPS United midfield combination of Artwell Mabhiza, Ashley Rambanepasi, Ian Bakala, Kamwendo, Lloyd Chitembwe, Cephas Chimedza and David Sengu. That was a well-oiled machine… cream tata!” 5. Collin Semwayo, nicknamed ‘’Computer’’ during his heydays at Gweru United, had this to say: “I played with Roseman ‘Dracko’ Mangwiro and Ishmael Meki. There was also the Sam Semwayo, Mangwiro and John Nyubu combination which served us well at Pisa Pisa.” Other combinations which were mentioned in this rich football discussion were Benjamin Musambudzi and Lloyd Mutasa at Green Buffaloes; Lloyd Mutasa, Johnson Mbaradza, Arnold Tsunga, Joseph ‘Shabba’ Takaringofa with Ian ‘Mhofu’ Matondo sometimes anchoring although he was often preferred as a centre-back at Tanganda. Benjamin Chimusoro, a man who knows a lot about Zimbabwean football, also talked highly about the Alick Nyoni and Chingumbe Masuku combination at Hwange, Pascal Chisamba, Kennedy Chihuri and Nkulumo ‘Daidzai vamwe’ Donga at Chapungu. Louis Sande, the former Fire Batteries midfielder, lauded the Ernest ‘’Baby Face’’ Makosa, David ‘’Chikwama’’ Mwanza and Rainos Mapfumo combination at Rio Tinto. Munya Murombe, another one I respect on all matters football, talked highly about Ernest Sibanda, Titus Majola and Tymon Mabaleka at Highlanders. He called them “the gentlemen of the beautiful game”, while legend Bernard Zikhali spoke highly of Tobias Moyo, Richard Manda and Njabulo Zulu at Ziscosteel; David Zulu, Wonder Phiri, John Phiri and David Mwanza at Rio Tinto, he called them “Simbi dzebasa!” The names and combinations keep rolling off but I have to conclude. Allow me to mention three final combinations. At Dynamos just before Independence I heard about Shaw ‘’Kojak’’ Handriade combining with Kuda Muchemeyi, at Glens Strikers fans talk highly of the Chimutanda, Dixon Ngwanya and Stix Mutizwa axis, it is regarded as one of the best. Finally, but not least, let me visit Shu Shine Football Club and pluck from them the midfield trio of Tavaka Gumbo, Vivian Sturu Mushekwi and Isaac Riyano. That was a class act! I have not touched on the post 2010 midfield combinations but I hope someone can take up the discussion and inform us on this one. For now, with these golden oldies, allow me to rest my case. Sisonke!

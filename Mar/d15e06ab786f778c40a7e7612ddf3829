The Herald INDIAN WELLS. — Rafael Nadal pulled off another great escape on Saturday, rallying from two breaks down in the third set to beat young American Sebastian Korda in the second round at Indian Wells. As Daniil Medvedev — the man Nadal beat with an epic comeback in the Australian Open tennis final — cruised to victory in his first match as the world’s top-ranked player,  while Nadal was made to work by 21-year-old Korda, ranked 38th in the world. “I feel very, very lucky today to be through,” Nadal said after a 6-2, 1-6, 7-6 (7/3) victory in the prestigious ATP Masters hard court tournament. “Sebastian was playing some fantastic tennis. I didn’t play my best match without a doubt (but) a lot of credit to him that he played so aggressive and he put me in a lot of trouble.” Medvedev had opened the action on Stadium Court and after saving a break point in the opening game had little trouble with 21-year-old Czech qualifier Tomas Machac, ranked 158th in the world. The US Open champion wrapped up a 6-3, 6-2 victory in 70 minutes, although Medvedev said it “was not as easy as it seems” after he sealed the win on a third match point. Medvedev said it was a “great feeling” to take the court as world No 1, “something I’ve always dreamed of.” Medvedev, who has never made it past the fourth round in four prior appearances, next faces France’s Gael Monfils, who beat Serbian Filip Krajinovic 6-3, 6-4. Nadal, who won a record 21st Grand Slam at the Australian Open in January, improved his perfect season’s start to 16 straight victories with a gritty display that owed more to experience. Korda led the third set 5-2 and twice served for the match. But he couldn’t conjure a match point as Nadal reeled off four games in a row. “I think it’s true that probably he got a little bit more nervous,” said Nadal, who next plays Britain’s Dan Evans, a 6-2, 6-0 winner over Argentina’s Federico Coria. Nadal was joined in the third round by rising young compatriot Carlos Alcaraz, who beat American Mackenzie McDonald 6-3, 6-3. The 18-year-old Alcaraz, coming off a title at the Rio Open, converted five of his nine break-point chances and rallied from a break down in the second set. Fifth-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas was pushed to the limit by Jack Sock, overcoming 28 forehand winners by the American in a 7-6 (7/5), 3-6, 7-6 (7/5) victory. Defending men’s and women’s champions Cameron Norrie and Paula Badosa both advanced. Britain’s Norrie, seeded 12th, defeated Pedro Martinez 6-3, 6-3 to earn a rematch of last year’s final against Georgia’s Nikoloz Basilashvili. — AFP

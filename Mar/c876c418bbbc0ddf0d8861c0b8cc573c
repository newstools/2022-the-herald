The Herald LONDON. — Mike Dean is set to hang up his whistle and cards and end his 22-year career as an English Premier League football referee at the end of the current campaign. The 53-year-old is arguably the most recognisable referee currently operating at the top of the English game, with his unique approach making him both highly controversial and must-watch in the same measure. Dean has refereed 553 Premier League matches since his introduction to the top division back in 2000. He has officiated more games than any of his counterparts and has also dished out more red cards — a tally of 114 – than any of his colleagues. But according to the Telegraph the 2021/22 season is looking to be his final, with Dean ready to call time on his on-field career. It is suggested that Dean is currently in talks with the Professional Game Match Officials (PGMOL) — the body that governs English officials — to potentially continue as one of just two full-time VAR officials, meaning his sole responsibility would be working from Stockley Park. Dean was reportedly prepared to quit ahead of last summer’s European Championship, only to be convinced by PGMOL chief Mike Riley to stay on whilst the next generation of match officials built up experience.  — The Mirror.

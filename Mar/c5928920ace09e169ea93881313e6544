The Herald LONDON. — Joe Root has reiterated his desire to remain England cricket captain after his side’s series defeat by West Indies. England slumped to a 10-wicket defeat in the third Test in Grenada as their winless run stretched to nine Tests. Root, who has been captain since 2017, has now overseen four series defeats in a row, this loss coming on the back of the 4-0 Ashes humbling by Australia. “I’m still very passionate about taking this team forward,” said Root, who has won a record 27 Tests leading England. “I feel there’s the support of the dressing room behind me and I’m desperate to see them smile and celebrating because we don’t feel that far away.” England have only won one of 17 Tests going back to February 2021 – their worst run since the 1980s. They also trail India 2-1 in a five-Test series that was postponed last summer with one game left to play. After the Ashes, Root said he wanted to continue as skipper, but after day three against West Indies, when England collapsed towards defeat, former captain Michael Vaughan said he felt Root may step down. However, asked if he wanted to continue, Root said: “I’ve made that quite clear. ‘’All I can control is what’s in my power and in my hands and I will do whatever I can in whatever capacity to help England win games of cricket and that will never change.” England are currently without a managing director and head coach after Ashley Giles stood down from the first of those positions and coach Chris Silverwood left following the Ashes. — BBC Sport

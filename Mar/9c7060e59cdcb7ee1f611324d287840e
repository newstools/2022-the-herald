The Herald CALIFORNIA. — Daniil Medvedev was sent crashing out of the ATP/WTA Indian Wells Masters tennis tournament in a stunning defeat to Gael Monfils on Monday that ended the Russian’s three-week reign as world number one. On a day of upsets in the California desert, Medvedev was the highest profile casualty to be sent packing, outfoxed 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 by veteran Frenchman Monfils. The shocks continued in the evening session as Greek fifth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas tumbled out to 21-year-old American Jenson Brooksby. Brooksby, ranked 43rd in the world, advanced to the last 16 with a 1-6, 6-3, 6-2 win. Earlier, the 35-year-old Monfils scored his first victory over a world number one since 2009 with a superb display to dispose of US Open champion Medvedev. The defeat means Novak Djokovic will on Monday return to the top of the world rankings, three weeks after Medvedev became number one. Monfils sealed victory in 2hr 6min after converting his sixth match point. “I’m in my zone and I’m a tough opponent for anyone,” Monfils said. “It’s been a long time since I’ve beaten a world number one, so I’m pretty happy.” — AFP

The Herald Crime Reporter A 35-year-old man who was on police wanted list was shot and killed in Zaka, Masvingo, after attacking police officers while he was resisting arrest on Wednesday. Douglas Mahoya had a warrant of arrest for two cases of assault and another two cases for malicious damage to property. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the incident and said the issue had nothing to do with the wearing of face mask as alleged in some sections of the media. “In fact, two police officers tracked the suspect after receiving information at GMB, Jerera,” he said. “After the identification of the officers to the suspect and production of a warrant of arrest, the suspect became violent and attacked Constable Nyezhe. “In the process, he got hold of a pistol which was in possession of the police detail and he was overpowered. He then went into a local shop and armed himself with a shovel and locked himself inside a room.” Asst Comm Nyathi said a police reinforcement team was then called from the police station to assist in arresting Mahoya. “As the police officers were pursuing him and about to effect arrest after the firing of three warning shots, the suspect wrestled with Constable Nyezhe and was unfortunately shot. He was pronounced dead on admission at Masvingo General Hospital. “The Zimbabwe Republic Police is conducting comprehensive investigations into this incident.”  Asst Comm Nyathi urged those facing criminal charges to cooperate and allow the due processes of the law to be undertaken.

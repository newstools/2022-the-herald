The Herald Court Correspondent Harare magistrate Mrs Letwin Rwodzi will on March 8 deliever ruling in the application by George Katsimberis to have senior prosecutor Mr Micheal Reza recused from his fraud case. Katsimberis  who was recently dumped by his lawyer Mr Tendai Biti stands accused of  duping a land developer of close to USS$1 million in a joint venture to build cluster houses in Harare’s Borrowdale suburb. The magistrate went on to dismiss Katsimberis’s application which was submitted by his new lawyer Mr Charles Warara to have the State ordered to give them particulars of his other matters which are pending at the High and Supreme Court. In dismissing the application, Mrs Rwodzi said she can’t force the State to give them particulars which are not relevant in this court. Senior prosecutor Mr Micheal Reza had also opposed the application by Katsimberis saying those particulars had nothing to do with the current matter.  “I can’t provide the defence with the particulars which they require as they have nothing to do with this present matter,” he said. Mrs Rwodzi postponed the matter to March 8 for continuation. On the previous sitting, Katsimberis through his new  lawyer Mr Charles Warara applied for the recusal of Mr Reza arguing that he would not give his client a fair trial.

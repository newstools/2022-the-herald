The Herald LONDON. – The Kremlin said yesterday that Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich played an early role in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, but the process was now in the hands of the two sides’ negotiating teams. Abramovich was asked by Ukraine to help mediate because of his background in Russia, where he made a fortune in the chaotic 1990s period of post-communist privatisation. “He did take part at the initial stage,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “Now the negotiations are between the two teams, the Russians and Ukrainians.” Russia and Ukraine are talking about a peace deal, but the question of territory has threatened to derail negotiations. The talks began on Feb. 28. read more In an attempt to force President Vladimir Putin to back down over Ukraine, the West has imposed sanctions on Russian billionaires such as Abramovich, Russian companies and Russian officials. Russia says the response of the West shows it is both decadent and deceitful and has bluntly warned that the post-1991 experiment in looking Westwards is over: from now on Moscow will look to China, India and other countries. Abramovich met former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder earlier this month as part of a search for peace. – Reuters

The Herald LONDON. — Rio Ferdinand has issued his support to Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta as some fans have criticised his decision to sell Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the January transfer window. The former Gunners captain has taken to life at new club FC Barcelona with relative ease and has shown signs of the kind of form that once made him so potent in north London. Aubameyang has found the net five times in his last three games for the Blaugrana, which is in stark contrast to the kind of return he was offering Arsenal towards the end of his time at the Emirates. The Gabon international scored none in his final six games for the Gunners before he was exiled from the first-team fold in early December following what was described as his “latest disciplinary breach”. This inevitably led to a complete breakdown in his relationship with Arteta, who went on to claim he tried to be the “solution” between the pair after Aubameyang publicly claimed the Spaniard was the one with the problem. — The Mirror

The Herald SABLES coach Brendan Dawson says he has been impressed by the constantly improving level of competition shown by locally-based players in the Nedbank Rugby Challenge in recent weeks ahead of the competition’s final scheduled for Harare Sports Club tomorrow. The 54-year-old legendary former Zimbabwe captain and his technical team members followed the season-opening competition with keen interest as it provided them with an opportunity to scout for local talent ahead of the Currie Cup First Division in South Africa next month. While only a handful of locally-based players made it into the Goshawks and Sables expanded squad for the Currie Cup and the preceding Rugby World Cup qualifiers in France, Dawson believes the Nedbank Rugby Challenge Cup has provided local rugby with a significant boost. “I’ve certainly been impressed by the level of competition in the Nedbank Rugby Challenge Cup and it’s something we can build on going forward,” Dawson told ZimSportLive in an interview. “Like I said previously it was always going to be difficult for the players in the first couple of weeks because; they’d not played any competitive rugby in over two years. — ZimSportLive

Senior UAE health officials, Zimbabwean Ambassador Lovemore Mazemo and the country’s Expo 2020 Dubai commissioner general, Ambassador Mary Mubi, would also deliver presentations. The country is driving at securing key investments in the health sector, which has come under spotlight under the Covid-19 pandemic period, which demands more resources and beefing up of key services. <img class="size-full wp-image-604812 aligncenter" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-07-at-9.24.49-AM.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-07-at-9.24.49-AM.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-07-at-9.24.49-AM-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />
Zimbabwe has, however, emerged resilient as it has invested more in developing domestic capacities in personal protective clothing, sanitation and hygiene products as well as pharmaceuticals, which it now seeks to export to the region and abroad. The Government has also identified several new health facility development projects as well as rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, among others, which need more investment with a higher scope for partnerships.
These will be under focus during today’s deliberations.

The Herald ALABAMA. – Two Olympic gold medals, 10 years in the NBA and countless big moments for Auburn University highlight this year’s class of Auburn athletics legends being inducted into the Tiger Trail. Zimbabwean swimmer Kirsty Coventry, basketball star Marquis Daniels and (American) football quarterback Stan White highlight the first group added to the Tiger Trail since 2019. The eight inductees will be honoured on April 8 and see the stone slabs going into the sidewalk in downtown Auburn recognising their achievement. The 2021 induction ceremony will be held at 6pm on April 8 in Neville Arena. Tickets are US$25. Interested attendees are asked to RSVP with the chamber of commerce. The Tiger Trail is downtown Auburn’s version of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The city of Auburn and chamber of commerce engrave the names of Auburn sports greats on the sidewalk in the downtown area. The Tiger Trail hasn’t been updated in three years as Covid-19 affected the United States. Zimbabwe’s swimming icon Coventry won seven Olympic medals in her illustrious career and several more in world championship meets. She helped lead the Auburn women’s team to the NCAA national championship in 2003 and 2004 and in 2005 she was the top individual scorer at the NCAA Championships. Daniels helped lead Auburn men’s basketball to the Sweet Sixteen in 2003 and after a long career in the NBA, he is back at Auburn as an assistant coach with the team. Like him, White did not leave Auburn for long, as he is back calling football games on Auburn’s radio network after his playing career. Carosone was part of Auburn’s rocketship ride to the Women’s College World Series in back-to-back seasons in 2015 and 2016.

The Herald JOHANNESBURG.  — South African football legend Neil Tovey believes that the head honchos of the mother body and its special member, the PSL, have made enough wealth over the years, that’s why they should let their egos go and work together to grow the game in country. On Saturday, Safa held their 30th ordinary congress at the Sandton Convention Centre. Their agenda included the amendment of their constitution. One of the laws that was upheld was the bar of the PSL club bosses from contesting for the Safa presidency. That feat slammed the door on the ambitions of club owners, including Chippa United’s chairman Siviwe “Chippa” Mpengesi, who had admitted that he will challenge current incumbent Danny Jordaan, who’s been in the top seat since 2013. It was also agreed by the majority voters that the chairman of the PSL, Irvin Khoza, cannot run for the Safa top office, although he’ll be automatically inaugurated as the association’s vice president after their elective congress this year. Over the years, it’s been common knowledge that Safa and the PSL do not see eye to eye, hence there are so many struggles in South African football. But Safa’s latest laws appear to have added more ruffle into the sour relationship. However, Tovey who’s played in the local top-flight, captained Bafana Bafana to the Afcon title in 1996 and served as the Safa’s technical director before, believes that there’d be a lot of progress in football if the two entities worked together. — IOL Sport

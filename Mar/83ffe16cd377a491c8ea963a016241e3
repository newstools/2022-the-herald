The Herald LONDON. — One week on from their mauling by arch-rivals Manchester City, Manchester United take on fellow English Premiership football’s top-four hopefuls Tottenham Hotspur today looking to salvage what is left of their season. While they still have the Champions League to fight for, recent form has led to United staring at the prospect of another disappointing campaign, with interim coach Ralf Rangnick unable to inspire the stuttering giants. The 13-times English Premier League champions are fifth in the standings, one point behind Arsenal in the final Champions League qualification spot, but Rangnick’s men have played three more games than Mikel Arteta’s side. United are winless in their last three matches in all competitions — they have not gone longer without a victory since a run of six games in September/October 2019. Uncertainty over who the next permanent manager will be is reportedly causing unrest in the United dressing-room, but Rangnick remains focused on the task at hand. — AFP.

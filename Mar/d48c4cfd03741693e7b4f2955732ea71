The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — Zimbabwe international Talent Chawapiwa has found a new home following his departure from DStv South African Premiership football outfit Sekhukhune United. Chawapiwa spent the first half of the season with Sekhukhune after joining from AmaZulu where he spent two and a half years. His time with Sekhukhune didn’t bring as much joy with eight appearances and no goals playing from the wing. However, just two months since his departure from Sekhukhune, the 29-year-old has found a new home with GladAfrica Championship club Platinum City Rovers. He has agreed on a deal running up to the end of the season and is set to make his debut after the international break when his paperwork is sorted. City Rovers coach Aschwin Sutton has confirmed the signing of the pacey winger who will widen the attacking options after making an impression at training. Chawapiwa has also played for Baroka before and in joining Rovers will hope he can elevate the club to a promotion play-offs position. He has over 100 appearances in the PSL. Though they are rookies in the first division, Rovers sit just six points behind leaders Richards Bay. Rovers only have Oupa Manyisa, Olaleng Shaku and Thabiso Nkoana as the experienced campaigners in their team. — KickOff.com.

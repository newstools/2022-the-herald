The Herald Business Reporter FERTILISER producer, NuFert Zimbabwe, is looking to widen the market reach of its unique prescription blends and tailor-made fertilisers. Unlike mass produced ammonium nitrate, the company’s main products — Pfumo top dressing blend and EcoBlack N — are tailor-made to farmers’ specific requirements in respect of both a particular crop, and condition of the soil. The Pfumo topdressing is a blended line, which has a similar nitrogen value as ammonium nitrate, but also has an additional 11 percent sulphur content that is good for plant growth, which is economical for the farmer and helps with protein in the crop. The EcoBlack N is a granulated urea, coated in an organic complex of carbon and other biological stimulants, which increase microbial activity around the granule optimising nitrogen use efficiency. Nufert Zimbabwe managing director, Anton Brown, said the group was looking to expand its outlets around the country. “We work through a number of outlets. Electrosales is one of our major outlets. So we are going to do a lot of promotions with Electrosales. “We also have our own depot in Concession, and an outlet in Mvurwi. We are looking at an outlet down in the Midlands area, and we are also looking at one now in Marondera. “We want to make the product readily available for farmers to pick up,” said Mr Brown. “And we are also looking to introduce a different size pack, a 25kg pack, because that amount will make it easier for someone who is utilising a smaller size plot.” A division of Origen Corporation, NuFert commenced operations in 2016. The company supplies and manufactures blended fertiliser for commercial farmers, co-operatives, agri-business and small scale farmers in Zimbabwe. In 2018, Nufert launched a new gypsum liquid formula on the market  almost a decade after production of mass gypsum had stopped in the country, giving farmers access to the much-needed product.

The Herald LONDON. — Arsenal are reportedly ready to quadruple Bukauo Saka’s salary as they look to tie down the academy graduate to a new deal. Saka has enjoyed a rapid rise in recent years and is now a key figure at the Emirates as the team continue to build under Mikel Arteta. The 20-year-old though still earns £30 000-a-week – making him one of the squad’s lowest earners. Arsenal now want to thrash out a new deal to reflect his importance in north London. The Sun reports that Saka will pocket £125 000-a-week if he remains at Arsenal with talks set for the end of the season. Arteta has made keeping the versatile winger a priority and told the club’s hierarchy they must pay whatever it takes to retain his services. His current contract, which was only signed 20 months ago, still has another two years to run but Saka’s representatives know that the club want to offer improved terms in the coming months. The player is happy to wait until the end of the season to discuss his future with his and the club’s focus on securing a place in the top four. Failure to make the Champions League is not set to impact on negotiations however. Head of football operations Richard Garlick, will take control of discussions and has been told not to waste time or haggle with Saka or his team. — The Mirror.

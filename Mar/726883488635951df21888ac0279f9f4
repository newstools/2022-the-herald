The Herald LONDON. — Men’s tennis governing body the ATP has handed world No. 3 Alexander Zverev a suspended eight-week ban for smashing his racket against the umpire’s chair at last month’s ATP 500 event in Acapulco, for which he was expelled from the tournament. Zverev was fined US$20 000 for verbal abuse, US$20 000 for unsportsmanlike conduct and forfeited more than US$31 000 in prize money and all rankings points earned from singles and doubles action at the Abierto Mexicano tournament. Following a review, the ATP found the 24-year-old German had committed “aggravated behaviour” and issued an additional fine of US$25 000 and an eight-week ban from any ATP-sanctioned event. The ATP said, however, the ban and the additional fine were suspended, providing that over a probation period ending one year after the incident, Zverev does not incur any more fines for unsportsmanlike conduct. After losing in doubles at Acapulco and upset over a line call in the match, Zverev approached umpire Alessandro Germani’s chair and came perilously close to hitting him as he swung at the official’s stand before heading towards his courtside seat.

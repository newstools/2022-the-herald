The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter TSUNGIRIRAI Chakawuya of Pro-Fitness Gym, Borrowdale, was crowned the 2022 Mr Novice senior men bodybuilding champion after he got the better of other seven athletes who took to the stage at the Zimbabwe College of Music on Saturday. The 30-year-old, who is under reigning Harare Classic champion, Donald Teguru, was outstanding both physically and on poses. Chakauya, who had prepared for Mr Novice for the past two years, said he was happy with the win and is now targeting more contests which are on the National Federation of Zimbabwe Bodybuilding and Fitness calendar. ‘’I am not going to rest. I will push and my next target is the Mr Ironman. I have worked hard for the last couple of years and I was waiting for a moment like this. “It was tough and I am grateful to my coach, Donald Teguru, who pushed me to the limit as it requires commitment to prepare for an event like Mr Novice. “It is my first time on the stage and he gave me all the tips on how to present myself. There are challenges like diet and I am happy that I am now going to eat sadza and more starch after a long period. The competition was tough but I had faith that I had done enough for the competition,” said Chakauya. Teguru was full of praise for the Harare-based hulk. “I am so happy on having one of my athletes taking to the podium. With the work we put in preparing, I think he deserved it. We are now going to work together for other contests after his graduation. “There are a lot of things at stake when preparing for such a big competition but we managed,” said Teguru. On second place was Exsivoir Dzvene of Family Fitness Gym who said it was wonderful to manage a podium finish.  Kudakwashe Nhema was third. 2022 Trysupps Novice Zimbabwe Results Men’s Physique Open Senior Men Bodybuilding Women Fitness Development Men’s Fitness Junior Men Bodybuilding

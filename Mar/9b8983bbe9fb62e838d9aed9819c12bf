The Herald BIRMINGHAM. — Aston Villa trio Marvelous Nakamba, Lucas Digne, and Kortney Hause will all return to training ahead of the English Premiership football clash with Wolves this weekend. Villa’s season run-in begins with the short trip to Molineux on Saturday afternoon following the international break. Digne missed the 1-0 defeat against Arsenal last time out after sustaining a hamstring injury just 10 minutes into the clash with West Ham United earlier this month. Hause has been absent for the last three English Premier League three matches with an abdominal problem, while Nakamba’s return has been long-awaited. The Zimbabwean underwent knee surgery in December, sidelining him for 14 top-flight games. Birmingham Mail‘s Ashley Preece and Leigh Curtis reported that Digne has already returned to full training with his national team France. Meanwhile, Hause will ‘link back up with the group at Bodymoor Heath’ at the beginning of the week. However, Gerrard is expected to exercise caution with Nakamba as he resumes “full training’’. The midfielder is unlikely to play against Wolves and could instead feature for the Under-23s against Stoke City tomorrow night as he aims to build up his fitness. The Wolves game may come too soon for Nakamba, while you’d imagine that Hause will be confined to the bench, given that he has only started four league matches this season. — BirminghamLive.

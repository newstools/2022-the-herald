The Herald Ivan Zhakata Arts Correspondent Musician Diana Samkange has featured rising hip hop singer K Prince Amaru on the remix of her hit track Munhu NdewaMwari. Munhu NdewaMwari is a Zimdancehall track on Ericanel Matemba Riddim produced by General Oliver of Gullyview Records in Glenview 8. The song has an overall break up theme and both lovers played by Diana and K prince and were fuming to each other in a poetic and fun way which retains the urban groove/hip hop feel that makes the track exceptional. “Initially, I did the original song late last year, and it is under the Ericanel Matemba Riddim produced by Ras Nigga and engineered and inspired by DJ Torne,” she said. “DJ Torne and K Prince approached me so that they could remix the track and I just thought it was a good initiative and I gave them the go ahead. I listened to the remix the young man did justice to the song. I believe he is going very far in the hip pop genre.” K Prince said it was an honour to feature with an icon such as Diana and wished for  more collaborations with big artistes. “Recently, I did a collaboration with Humba and Quality and I am looking forward to work with Maskiri, Holy 10, Poptain and Cindy Munyavi among other artistes,” he said. “I think an artiste cannot make it alone, and there is need for collaborations. You will learn a lot from collaborations as well as creating relations because music is no longer just a hobby, but a business as well. “The experience of working with an established artiste is worthwhile. It opens up new hoard of fans and new channels of spreading music. Munhu NdewaMwari track is set to have a high quality video anytime soon and it is available on YouTube and other music stores.”

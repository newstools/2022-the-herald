The Herald SYDNEY. — Australian cricket legend Shane Warne’s death in Thailand on Friday was from natural causes, police have confirmed. A senior Thai police official said the post mortem exam showed no signs of foul play in the 52-year-old’s death. Warne, who is considered to be one of the greatest cricketers of all time, was found unresponsive on Koh Samui island, where he was holidaying. The Australian government is bringing his body back to Australia where he will be given a state funeral. A spokesman for the Thai police said the player’s family had been informed of the result of a post mortem and accepted it. Warne is survived by his three children with former wife Simone Callahan. His mastery of leg-spin — a style of bowling that declined during the 1970s and 1980s when fast bowlers dominated — revolutionised cricket. He took 708 Test wickets, the second most of all time, in 145 matches across a stellar 15-year international career.

Meanwhile, Warne offered gifts of his old cricket clothing and ate the traditional Australian snack of Vegemite on toast in the final hours before his death on Friday, an associate of the cricketing great said. Tom Hall was staying at the resort in Koh Samui, Thailand, where Warne was found unconscious in his room in a villa he shared with three travelling companions. Hall, chief executive of The Sporting News website, said there were “no unusual circumstances” surrounding Warne’s death on Friday after the former spin bowler caught up with friends and watched some cricket on TV. “The first question is, ‘How can we watch Australia v Pakistan Test here in Thailand; the game’s about to start?’, Hall wrote on the website, quoting Warne. —AFP.

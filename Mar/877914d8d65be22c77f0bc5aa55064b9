THE Harare Metropolitan Tennis Board chairperson Walter Jera says the coaches’ seminars being held by Total Greatness International (TGI) are key in complementing their efforts towards grassroots development. TGI is a non-profit organisation that seeks to develop tennis in Zimbabwe and was founded by one of the country’s top players Takanyi Garanganga. One of the organisation’s focus areas is capacity building for local coaches and teachers. In a move expected to contribute to the local sport, TGI is holding seminars for coaches in three provinces. The seminars are being led by Martin Rocca and Abel Rincon of TennisAid, an organisation based in Spain. The first one was held in Harare on Monday at Old Hararians Sports Club with focus on the basics of the sport in junior development. Jera said they are grateful for the initiative by TGI as it complements their efforts on junior development. “Admittedly like in every other sport junior development is central to the execution of any sport if you want to excel in competitive sport. So for us Harare Metropolitan Tennis Board, we have embarked on development for our juniors, starting from grassroots which is our districts. “What we have at these centres are sometimes volunteers who are coaching our kids hence the centrality and importance of this programme where we have now received these Spanish coaches, who have been involved in the game at a higher level. “So we are pleased and very grateful that they have agreed to come and impart knowledge to our tennis developers… We are truly grateful to Takanyi Garanganga,” said Jera. Rocca and Rincon are expected to lead two more seminars in Bulawayo and Mutare on Wednesday and Friday respectively.

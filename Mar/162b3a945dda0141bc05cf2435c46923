The Herald Lloyd Mwale in NGEZI Cranborne Bullets . . . . . . . . . . . . . .(1)1 Manica Diamond . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (0)1 CRANBORNE Bullets’ coach Nesbert “Yabo’’ Saruchera was a happy man after his side held former leaders Manica Diamonds to a draw in this Castle Lager Premiership football match at Baobab Stadium yesterday. Cranborne Bullets took the lead in the 12th minute when Tapiwa Chibunyu beat Manica Diamond’s keeper, Ashley Reyners , with a low shot. Chibunyu could have scored his second goal of the day moments later but he saw his shot going wide with Reyners lying on the ground. Thereafter, Manica Diamonds dictated the pace in midfield, where Pascal Manhanga and captain Liberty Chakoroma reigned supreme. In the 37th minute Manhanga’s shot from outside the box went over after he had combined well with stocky Farai Mugumwa. In the second half, Manica Diamonds were a revitalised side as they came out looking for an equaliser and a double substitution by their gaffer, Johanisi Nhumwa, in the 62nd minute paid dividends when Nyasha Chintuli came to the end of a fine solo move by Tapiwa Charakupa to equalise, breaking the hearts of the Cranborne Bullets fans. In a post-match interview, Cranborne Bullets coach, Saruchera, said he was happy with the single point his charges collected against the in-form Mutare side. “I’m very happy with a point we have collected after coming from three defeats. I have a strong belief that the boys are showing a positive attitude,” said Saruchera. While Saruchera was satisfied with a draw, Manica Diamonds coach Nhumwa felt his charges underrated their opponents “It was two points lost. My boys underrated our opponents which resulted in us going down in the first half,” Nhumwa said.

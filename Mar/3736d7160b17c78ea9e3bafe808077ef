The Herald Ellina Mhlanga Senior Sports Reporter VETERAN distance runner Mike Fokorani is delighted to be back in competition as he prepares for the Two Oceans Ultra-marathon after some time off due to Covid-19. The 56km ultra-marathon is set to take place on the weekend of April 16 and 17 after a two-year hiatus because of Covid-19. The Two Oceans half-marathon will take place on April 16 and the ultra-marathon will take place on April 17. Fokorani is a seasoned participant at the race and his best performance was in 2016 when he won the ultra-marathon. He was part of the field at the CBZ Marathon on Sunday at Old Georgians Sports Club. “So far my preparation seems to be going very well. On the 6th of March I ran the 50km race in PE (Port Elizabeth) and I was position seven. I ran my best time of 2 hours 49 minutes, so it was a positive sign that my preparations are progressing well. “Today (Sunday), of course, I ran but it was not like a competition, I just took it as part of my training for Two Oceans. “I am aiming high for Two Oceans. Of course I might go for Comrades but Two Oceans is my first preference,” said Fokorani. He was second in the CBZ Marathon, coming behind Trust Hove in 2 hours 28 minutes 7 seconds.

The Herald Court Reporter A GOKWE man has been jailed for three years for carjacking and threatening to kill his unsuspecting victim with an axe. Norman Ndhlovu (23) had pleaded not guilty to the charge of robbery when he appeared before Gokwe magistrate Mr Musaiwone Shortgame. But he was convicted after a fully contested trial.  Mr Shortgame slapped Ndhlovu with a four-year prison sentence but suspended one year on condition of good behaviour. Appearing for the State, Ms Getrude Shoko proved that Ndhlovu robbed Mr Godfrey Chomupapa of the car belonging to his employer, Mr Iden Chiketa. She proved that on the evening of January 10 this year, Ndhlovu phoned Mr Chiketa requesting to hire his vehicle from Mapfungautsi in Gokwe to Muchakata Business Centre in the same area.  Mr Chiketa instructed Chomupapa, who is the complainant in the matter, to go to Mapfungautsi and pick Ndhlovu using a Subaru Impreza. Chomupapa complied and picked Ndhlovu and drove him towards Muchakata Business Centre. After driving for about 10kM along the Gokwe-Kwekwe Road, Ndhlovu asked Chomupapa to turn left into a gravel road and drove towards Muchakata Business Centre, and after driving about 1km along the gravel road, Ndhlovu requested Chomupapa to stop on the pretext that he wanted to relieve himself. Both men disembarked from the vehicle.  While outside the vehicle, Ndlovu accosted Chomupapa with a small axe, charging towards him. Chumupapa ran away for dear life, with Ndhlovu in hot pursuit, pelting him with stones. He struck Chomupapa twice on the head and back. Ndhlovu, who was outpaced by Chomupapa, then returned to the vehicle and drove himself towards Muchakata Business Centre but the car ran out of fuel. Chomupapa then went to the business centre where he mobilised villagers, among them Mr Welsh Mpofu who had a Toyota Vitz, to make a follow-up of his stolen vehicle. They caught up with Ndhlovu who waved them to stop for help, leading to his arrest after a scuffle.

The Herald ZIMBABWE have slipped from 12th to 13th-place in the latest World Netball rankings which were released earlier this week. In Africa, the Gems are still ranked fourth behind continental powerhouses South Africa, Uganda and Malawi. In the world rankings, South Africa are the best-placed African team at 5th place, one place ahead of Uganda while Malawi are occupying 7th place. World Netball on Tuesday released the latest world rankings which follows the annual update performed to ensure that the rankings reflect the most current form of the international teams. The last annual update took place on July 1, 2020, however due to Covid very few international matches took place between  July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021, therefore the decision was made by the WN Board, on the recommendation of statistician David Kendix, to delay the 2021 annual update until after the final qualification date for the Commonwealth Games, which was January 31, 2022.

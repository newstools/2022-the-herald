A 23-year-old man was seriously burnt last month after he attempted to cut a live Zesa wire from a pole along Lytton Road in Rugare, Harare. The incidents saw parts of Rugare and Kambuzuma suburbs plunging into darkness. Lloyd Matara was arrested while hiding at a certain place in Rugare before being taken to Harare Magistrates Court charged with damaging, destroying or interfering with any apparatus used to generate electricity. He was not asked to plead to the charges when he appeared before magistrates Mrs Yeukai Dzuda, who remanded him in custody to January 29. It is alleged that on December 14, 2021 at around 2:30am Matara went to a ZESA H-cement pole along Lytton Road, and allegedly climbed up to the top. While he was in the process of cutting the copper conductors, he was shocked and burnt, resulting in him falling. He sustained burns on both legs up to knee level but he managed to crawl to House Number A22 Nyashanu Road, Rugare where he sought help. It is said people who stay in the neighbourhood were awakened by electricity sparks and an explosion, which took place after Matara’s attempt to steal the Zesa cables. The residents tracked Matara to the house and apprehend him. They found him with a Zesa 16x 30cm Buytle cable. Upon being interviewed, Matara led detectives to the scene where he narrated how he intended to steal the cables. His shoes were recovered at the scene.

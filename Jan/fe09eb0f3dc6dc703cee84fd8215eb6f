The Herald LONDON. — Manchester United are facing an exodus of players from Old Trafford that could hit double figures before the start of next football season. Morale at the club is at a low point after interim boss Ralf Rangnick inherited a divided dressing-room from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, with a staggering total of 17 players said to be unhappy. Many of them — including several stars — are under contract and will not be allowed to leave, but there is still expected to be a significant number of departures over the next eight months. Rangnick has become aware of the situation following a series of meeting with players to discuss their futures. Anthony Martial will leave on loan this month if Sevilla improve their opening loan offer, and is set to move permanently in the summer. Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard have shown no inclination to renew their contracts which are due to run out at the end of June, enabling both to leave on free transfers and deal United a huge financial blow. Edinson Cavani has been told that he cannot leave in January but he will also be a free agent in the summer along with Juan Mata who has options to go out on loan to Spain and MLS this month. Donny van de Beek, Dean Henderson and Eric Bailly are all unhappy over a lack of playing time and are open to moves at the end of the season. Although Phil Jones played for the first time in two years against Wolves on Monday, he turns 30 next month and wants regular football. The former England defender has been linked with a loan to Benfica. — Mailonline.

The Herald MELBOURNE. — Regardless of who made an error on the visa or the vaccination waiver or whatever, the reality yesterday for men’s tennis No. 1 Novak Djokovic was spending one his important religious holidays in an Australian detention hotel working on his challenge against deportation. He has been receiving calls from Serbia, including from his parents and the president, hoping to boost his spirits. A priest from the Holy Trinity Serbian Orthodox Church in Melbourne sought permission from immigration authorities to visit the nine-time Australian Open champion to celebrate the Orthodox Christmas. “Our Christmas is rich in many customs and it is so important that a priest visits him,” the church’s dean, Milorad Locard, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. “The whole thing around this event is appalling. That he has to spend Christmas in detention . . . it is unthinkable.” Djokovic’s supporters gathered outside the Park Hotel, used to house refugees and asylum seekers near downtown Melbourne, waving flags and banners. They mixed with human rights advocates who were there more to highlight the plight for other longer-term people in detention, many who’ve complained about their living conditions and exposure to the coronavirus in the pandemic. Djokovic thanked fans for their support while he remains in a detention hotel awaiting confirmation on his visa. It’s the Serb’s first social media post since being detained at Melbourne airport after his visa was denied ahead of the Australian Open. ‘’Thank you to people around the world for your continuous support. I can feel it and it is greatly appreciated,’’ he posted on his Instagram story. The world No.1 has been at the Park Hotel in Carlton after being denied entry to the country following visa complications and now has to wait until Monday to see if he will be deported. – AP.

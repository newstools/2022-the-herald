The Herald Columbus Mabika Herald Reporter The Turkish Embassy over the weekend donated shoes to thousands of children in Zvimba as part of its programmes of touching lives through humanity. The gesture is also part of the embassy’s efforts to complement Government in rebuilding communities following Covid -19 induced hardships. Handing over the shoes, Turkish Embassy representative Mr Adam Yidi Wadi said the embassy was touched by the plight of rural kids, hence their intervention in support of Government initiatives to cushion the vulnerable. Mr Wadi stated the initiative will help to donate shoes to kids from poor backgrounds. “We got so many kids in our rural communities who need school shoes. Our purpose is to close the gap of poverty and make sure learners are confident enough to know they are supported and loved,” he said. Mr Wadi recognised some kids refuse to go to school at a younger age based on things like not having shoes. “Some of the children lack confidence while they are at school because they feel different. We try by all means to supply them with shoes, which helps to build their self-esteem and adds value to their performance at school,” he said. He said this is also to show them they can fit in with other kids in society, which plays a huge role in developing a child. “This will also help parents so they may know that even though they don’t have that much, there is always someone who will try to assist,” he said.

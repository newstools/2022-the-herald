The Herald ROME. — Juventus were the toast of Italy’s papers yesterday morning after their stunning comeback against Roma on Sunday night piled more misery on Jose Mourinho, who is now under fire. Roma held a 3-1 lead over Juve in the second half of their Italian Serie A football clash before Manuel Locatelli, Dejan Kulusevski and Mattia De Sciglio scored three times in just seven minutes to turn the game on its head. Matthijs De Ligt was even sent off in the 81st minute but 10-man Juve held on to seal a dramatic 4-3 away victory after Tammy Abraham, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Lorenzo Pellegrini scored for Roma. Wojciech Szczesny also saved a late penalty from Pellegrini in a match where Ainsley Maitland-Niles made his Roma debut after joining from Arsenal last week. Il Romanista — a paper dedicated to covering Roma — wróte ‘’the nightmare’’ across their front page yesterday with a picture of their team looking stunned at the final whistle. The other main Italian papers herald the comeback from Massimiliano Allegri’s men. La Gazzetta dello Sport call the result ‘’joy and pain’’ because there are fears over Juve forward Fedrico Chiesa after he went off with an ankle injury just 24 minutes into the match. Corriere dello Sport, meanwhile, hail an ‘’incredible blitz’’ from Juve after scoring three goals in seven minutes, next to a picture of Mourinho looking furious. The paper also gave Mourinho a match rating of 4.5, explaining: ‘’The Special One could not find remedies as Roma collapsed in the final minutes of the game.’’ Tuttosport led with ‘’incredible Juve’’ after the result and praise what could be a big three points in the race for the top four in Serie A. They also gave Maitland-Niles a rating of just 4.5 and said he was at fault for two of the Juventus goals. The defeat leaves Roma with a mountain to climb to reach the Champions League places — they trail fourth-place Atalanta by nine points. — Mailonline.

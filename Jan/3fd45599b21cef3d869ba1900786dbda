The Herald CHRISTCHURCH. — Trent Boult bagged five wickets as Bangladesh were rolled for 126 at stumps in reply to New Zealand’s mammoth 521 for six declared in the second Test cricket in Christchurch yesterday. The last wicket fell in the last over of the day as the Bangladesh innings ended inside a session and a half, and 395 in arrears. The hosts must win the Test to square the two-match series after losing the first test by eight wickets. They had made batting look easy after being sent in on a green wicket with opener Tom Latham in the middle for more than nine hours for his 252, while Devon Conway added 109 and Tom Blundell was 57 not out. When the Black Caps declared, pace bowlers Boult and Tim Southee then showed how to move the ball on a verdant surface as they ripped through the Bangladesh line-up. Boult put the difference down to local knowledge. “That’s the beauty of Test cricket, the little subtleties that come with different grounds,” he said. “The wicket obviously offers a little bit of bounce with a bit of grass on it. “It’s all about the length here, of us getting them on the front foot and encouraging them to drive down the ground . . . pitching the ball up and hopefully we can get 10 (wickets) pretty quickly again.” Boult ended with five for 43 while Southee took three for 28. Only two relative Test novices, Yasir Ali and Nurul Hasan, provided any resistance. Yasir, in his third test, made 55 while Nurul was out for 41 in his fifth test. “Of course we’re disappointed,” Bangladesh batting coach Ashwell Prince said. “If we can learn something from the Kiwis batting on day one it was that they left a lot more balls outside the off stump. “The Kiwis got it swinging as well today and bowled really well and made it tough for our guys.” — AFP.

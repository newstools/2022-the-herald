The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — South Africa’s large alcohol producers are struggling to satisfy demand, which is hitting tavern owners hard. South African Breweries (SAB) confirmed hat due to “supply chain constraints” it can’t deliver all customer orders, while Distell, which produces Savanna, Hunter’s and Klipdrift, says it is experiencing “severe” glass shortages, as well as a shortage of aluminium, used in the production of cans, and corks. In KwaZulu-Natal, Nhlanhla Mbhele had no choice but to shut down his 15-year-old tavern, Oskido247, in Empolweni after struggling to find product to sell. Like many other people who sell liquor, Mbhele sourced most of his supply from producers SAB and Distell. His biggest moneymakers were beer brands Carling Black Label, Castle and Hansa, all sold by SAB, and popular cider Savanna, from Distell. “Due to ongoing supply chain constraints that have been driven by the Covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns, SAB can confirm that it is not possible at this time to fulfil all customer orders,” a SAB spokesperson said. — News24

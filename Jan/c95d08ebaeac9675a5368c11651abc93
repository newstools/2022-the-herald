The Herald Johannesburg. – Keamogetswe Motlhale from Mahikeng, known as “QV”, lasted just over 48 hours before deciding that she’s had enough and walked out of the 5th season of Mzansi Magic’s Big Brother Mzansi that started on Sunday night. She is now receiving psychological counselling. Yesterday afternoon Mzansi Magic confirmed that QV decided to leave, citing “personal reasons”. QV’s exit comes a day after the housemates were tasked to share their life stories. Keamogetswe shared that she was raped multiple times when she was six. Shirley Adonisi, M-Net director for local entertainment channels said:“Keamogetswe Motlhale, one of the Big Brother Mzansi housemates known as QV, has taken the decision to leave the Big Brother house for personal reasons. “QV bid farewell to the remaining housemates and left, and a psychologist is now working with her to ensure a smooth transition back into the outside world and guide her through her journey forward. We wish her all the best on her journey, and she has our full support,” explained Shirley Adonisi. Big Brother Mzansi, revived for a 5th season after 7 years as a Covid-19 safe show and produced inside a so-called “Covid-19 safe production bubble”, is done by Red Pepper Productions as a South African adaptation of the Banijay format with Dineo Phantshang as series producer, OJ Meketsi as series director, Gbenga Kayode as consulting series director, Jessica Setati as production manager, and with Cecil Barry and Natalie Bleksley as the co-executive producers. Big Brother Mzansi runs daily, and weekly highlights air on Mzansi Magic (DStv 161) and as a 24-hour pop-up channel on MultiChoice’s DStv channel 198. –

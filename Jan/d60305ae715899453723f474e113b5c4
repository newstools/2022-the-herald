Mr Masaire leaves Zimra in a sound position as the tax collector has managed to surpass the net revenue targets for 2021 despite the disruptions caused by the Covid-19-induced lockdowns. Meanwhile, the ZIMRA board has announced the appointment of board Member, Dr Moris Bekezela Mpofu, as Acting Commissioner-General with effect from January 1, 2022, until April 30, 2022. “In the same breath, on behalf of the board, I announce the appointment of board member, Dr Moris Mpofu, as Acting Commissioner-General with effect from January 1, 2022 until April 30, 2022 with the hope that within that time the processes of recruiting a substantive Commissioner-General would have been finalised,” announced Mrs Matambo.

The Herald LONDON. — Liverpool have signed winger Luis Diaz from Porto for an initial fee of £37m. The 25-year-old has signed a five-and-a-half-year contract with the English Premier League football side and will wear the number 23 shirt. The fee for Diaz could rise to as much as £49m if potential add-ons are triggered during his time at Anfield. The Colombia international was a top target for manager Jurgen Klopp in the summer, but interest from Tottenham this month accelerated their plans. And Klopp has hailed “outstanding’’ Luis Diaz after Liverpool confirmed they had signed the Colombia winger in a £37.5m deal from Porto. Diaz, who was heavily linked with Liverpool’s English Premier League rivals Tottenham earlier in the month, has signed a contract until 2027 with the Merseyside club. The 25-year-old has scored 14 goals in 18 league appearances this season and will wear the number 23 shirt at Anfield, which was previously held by Xherdan Shaqiri. Diaz has scored 14 goals and provided five assists in 18 league appearances this season for Porto, who are top of Portugal’s Primeira Liga. The Colombia international is currently on international duty for World Cup qualifying matches so is unlikely to arrive in Liverpool until the end of this week. Klopp said: “I could not be happier that we’ve been able to get this deal done and bring Luis to Liverpool. “I have always been a believer in only signing players in January if you would want to sign them in the summer, and that’s very much the case with Luis.” — Sky Sports.

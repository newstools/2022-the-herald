The Herald SYDNEY. — England earned a famous and battling draw on day five of the fourth Ashes Test cricket in Sydney to end Australia’s hopes of a 5-0 series sweep yesterday. The tourists were 13 balls from safety when Jack Leach edged Steve Smith behind, leaving it to Stuart Broad and last batter James Anderson to guide England home. With the light fading and every Australia fielder around the bat, Broad and Anderson blocked out Smith and Nathan Lyon to secure a hard-fought draw, closing on 270-9. England skipper Joe Root praised his battered team’s character to stave off Australia’s victory push and hold on for a gritty draw in Sydney as injured wicket keeper Jos Buttler prepared to fly home. Old stagers Anderson and Broad batted out the final two tense overs to give the beleaguered tourists a fighting draw and deny dominant Australia a fourth straight Test win in the lopsided series. It comes after England meekly surrendered the Ashes, heavily losing the first three tests inside 12 days amid bitter recriminations over the performances of the players, coaching staff and the captain. But despite failing to pass 300 in any of their eight innings so far in the series, England, with nothing to play for but pride, saw the draw as a test of character. “Relief is the overwhelming emotion and I’m quite proud too,” Root said.  — BBC Sport.

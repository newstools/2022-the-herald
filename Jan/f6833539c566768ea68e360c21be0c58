The Herald Crime Reporter ARMED robbers raided a Mashwede Holdings food court in Southlea Park, Harare early yesterday morning and got away with a safe containing more than US$5 000 after attacking some security guards manning the premises. No arrests have been made and police are still looking for the suspects. The matter is being handled by detectives from the CID Homicide. Although the details were still sketchy, sources close to the investigations said the gang raided the premises at around 1am before attacking the security guards manning the premises. They then broke into one of the offices and took away the safe that contained the money before disappearing. A manhunt has since been launched for the robbers. The case comes after police in November roped in the International Police Organisations (Interpol) to track down one of Zimbabwe’s most wanted armed robbery suspects, Conwell Junior Kasambarare (26), believed to be part of the famous Musa Taj Abdul gang. He is facing a plethora of robbery and housebreaking charges. Kasambarare recently jumped bail and police have launched a massive manhunt for him, yet again. He was re-arrested early this year on charges of committing a spate of heists countrywide, including the famous Mashwede Holdings robbery. Kasambarare was granted bail on these armed robbery charges last month, but failed to turn up in court for his latest remand hearing last Tuesday, prompting the issuance of a warrant of arrest. Kasambarare, Spicer Takawira and Musafare Mupamhanga are alleged to be part of the gang that raided Mashwede Holdings in 2020 and got away with over US$100 000, R42 000, $14 000 worth of fuel coupons, firearms and 20 live rounds of ammunition.

The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo Senior Arts Reporter Zimbabwe Music Awards (ZIMA 2021) contestant with seven nominations, Nutty O has hinted on his regional collaboration with South African singer Makhadzi, Botswana musician Han C and record producer Mr Brown. The “Handipere Power” hit-maker revealed in an interview with The Herald Arts that a single is in pipeline but no name yet. “It is a good collaboration and I am happy about it,” he said. “The collaboration has been strategic in its own and the fact that we continue to combine Southern Africa’s finest, I can tell you that it’s massive. So far no name has been discussed yet as we have been working on the chorus and lyrics.” “This one is a good love song. We are still working on it. I received the song on Tuesday and Mr Brown told me he had put on Makhadzi and said just do your magic. <img class="size-full wp-image-597895" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Han-C.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Han-C.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Han-C-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Han C “I can’t reveal further details but the song will be out after everything is perfect. I am not sure about the video plans,” he said. Asked about how he landed such collaboration, Nutty O said he got a call from Mr Brown and immediately jumped on board. “Mr Brown called me and briefed me about the collaboration. I was so excited about it. I am sure fans will love the song as it will blow their minds. Like I said, I can’t share much details on the project for now. I am in the studio now perfecting my hook,” he said. The musician who is also on tour in South Africa said 2022 started on a good note. “This Friday I will be at Helensvale, Harare for the Capitalk radio station fifth birthday celebrations together with my brother ExQ. It is called “Double Trouble”. Then on Saturday I will be jamming in South Africa at the “First Enjoyment Party 2022”, featuring live performances by Gigi Latmayne, Pinky Girl, Pabi Cooper and Drip Gogo among others. I promise to deliver the best for my South African fans,” he added. Commenting on the ZIMA nomination, the Mbare-bred musician said last year was a manifestation of God’s plan. <img class="size-full wp-image-597900" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Makhadzi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Makhadzi.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Makhadzi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Makhadzi “I can say somehow the people have responded to the seed (‘Mustard Seed’ album) and I am glad I am changing the narrative. The nominations are validating my process, whatever the formula I engaged is a powerful one. I can say it’s a win for me just being nominated itself. I am humbled,” he said. For the awards, he has been nominated for Song of the Year, Best Male Artist, Best International Zimbabwean, Best Collaboration, Best Music Video, Best Zimdancehall and Best Album.

The Herald BEIJING.- Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, on Tuesday stressed rigorous and unswerving efforts in further promoting full and strict party governance. Xi, also Chinese president and chairman of the Central Military Commission, vowed to maintain a zero-tolerance stance on corruption while addressing the sixth plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI). Members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Li Keqiang, Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang, Wang Huning and Han Zheng attended the meeting. Zhao Leji, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and head of the CCDI, presided over the meeting. Since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, the CPC Central Committee has improved Party conduct, upheld integrity and combated corruption with unprecedented courage and resolve, Xi said. “Certain unhealthy tendencies that hadn’t been curbed for a long time have been reined in, many problems that had long plagued us have been remedied, and serious potential dangers in the party, the country and the military have been rooted out,” Xi said. The problem of lax and weak governance over Party organisations has been addressed at the fundamental level, and a successful path to breaking the historical cycle of rise and fall has been blazed through the Party’s self-reform, Xi added. – Xinhua.

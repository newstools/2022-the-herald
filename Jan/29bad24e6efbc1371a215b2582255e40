The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter HIGH-FLYING Herentals Under-20 team will face a tough test when they entertain Harare City Cubs in the ZIFA Northern Region Division One Soccer League match at the National Sports Stadium B Arena this afternoon. The two developmental sides, who work as feeders to Premier League sides Harare City and Herentals, have young and energetic players. The Paul Benza-coached Herentals Under-20 side is yet to suffer defeat in the five games they have played so far and are yet to concede a goal. Benza said they were taking each game as it comes and will never look on Harare City Cubs’ current form. “With football anything can happen this is a new team as most of the players I had have since graduated to the senior team. The boys are doing well and it is through hard work that they are winning games. “We are looking forward to a tough match but we are ready,’’ said Benza. Harare City Cubs are struggling as they have managed a single draw and lost three matches in the four games they have played so far. The other matches will see Simba Bhora who are enjoying so much support at their Wadzanai Stadium welcome Wonder Ngoko’s Come Again as Karoi United will play Chinhoi Stars in a Mashonaland West derby.

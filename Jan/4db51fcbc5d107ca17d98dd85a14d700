The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter BORROWDALE Park and racecourse will host their first race meeting in over a month with the Hachiman Sprint to be run over 1100 metres tomorrow. The annual event will have seasoned sprinters but it is Three to Tango who is tipped ahead of seven other runners who will take to the starting stalls. A multiple long distance winner who has the Zimbabwe Derby and the 2020 Zimbabwe Challenge in his cabinet, Three to Tango will have Nolbert Takawira on the irons. Coming under the Debra Swanson yard, which has two representatives only, the runner will have to contend with stablemate Varnirca who is rated fourth. The field is a balanced one as trainers Bridget Stido and Vanessa Birke have two runners apiece while Thomas Mason and Gorkhan Terzi has one each. Stido has brought in Emerald Floe and Citrusdal as Birke come on board with Mind Master and Gladstone. Mason has Jubilee while Terzi will put Seven Seas to the starting line-up. A total of eight races will be witnessed tomorrow and the Hachiman Sprint will be the future race and it has US$2 000 purse money which will see the winner walking home US$1 000 richer with second place getting US$500 as third place pockets US$300 and fourth place finish will have a US$200 reward. In 2020, the race was won by Christofle, then came Silver Coin, What A Dandy and Verdier. The 2021 edition saw What A Dandy coming out tops as Gladstone, who is the only one who is making a return this year, was second as Golden Lion and Verdier completed the other two places.

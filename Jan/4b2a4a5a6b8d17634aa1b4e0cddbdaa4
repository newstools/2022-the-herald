The Herald Tadious Manyepo Sports Reporter Former Black Rhinos striker Tawanda Macheke has become the latest Zimbabwean to join a South African top-flight side after penning a two-year contract with Maritzburg United. He has been a free agent since the expiry of his contract with the army team on New Year’s eve. Macheke was unveiled by the Team of Choice along with Friday Samu, Lucky Baloyi, Steven Pereira and Genino Palace yesterday. The lanky forward joins the Ernst Middendorp side after a fruitful flirtation with Black Rhinos in which he won two accolades – Player of the Year and the golden boot at the team’s awards gala for 2021. Macheke scored two goals in the Chibuku Super Cup to help the Herbert Maruwa team reach the quarter-finals and he also notched as many goals in two league matches. Black Rhinos secretary-general Edward Mutukwa hailed the move. “We are more than delighted to see our former player securing such a big move. That shows we are doing something great as a team,” said Mutukwa. Before settling at Chauya Chipembere, Macheke had had an unsuccessful stint with Dynamos.

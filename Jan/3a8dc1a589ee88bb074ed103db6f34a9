The Herald Walter Nyamukondiwa Kariba Bureau Kariba District Hospital has received a major boost after Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) donated foodstuffs and detergents. The donations include cartons of rice, beans, sugar, relish, cooking oil and bars of soap among other items. They were bought with proceeds from last year’s edition of the annual fundraising golf tournament organised by CUT in Chinhoyi. <img class="size-full wp-image-598202 aligncenter" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-28-at-11.52.19-AM.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-28-at-11.52.19-AM.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-28-at-11.52.19-AM-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />

” We are here to stay and we would like to thank Kariba Municipality for accepting us and giving us somewhere to operate from,” he said. “We continue to appeal to our local authority to provide more land so that we can carry out more projects through our strategic business units to create employment for the local community.” The gesture was welcomed by Kariba Municipality deputy mayor Farai Magevha who said the community could only develop with the support of the corporate world.

Confirmed. It was colourful and splendiferous! Everything went by the script and those who were not invited were left green with envy. If nothing extremely exquisite happens within the next 11 months, it might as well pass as the greatest lobola event of 2022. Laugh out loud! Well, the couple painted the town green. According to social media fanatics the event has already been touted as the best to happen in 2022 so far, because of the A-list guests, the theme, the decorum, a hodgepodge of flashy cars and the cake. Well, green was the main theme for the much talked about “lobola celebrations” of Zimbabwean fashion designer and entrepreneur Daniella Allen and Nigerian business mogul Igho Ubiribo, affectionately known as “Tiny” in the celebrity world. Though the year has just started, some critics say it isn’t too early to classify the event as the best of 2022. The couple, who are based in the United States, flew into the country three days before their lavish celebrations which were held at “The Nest at Thirty” in Helensvale over the weekend. It was Nigerian themed from the dressing to the buffet. The event was graced by Nigerian superstar Davido who flew into the country with his friends in his private jet. The metre-tall cake was by Mrs Micheals brand. By the way, the invited guests were put into groupings, based on how they related to the couple. Each relationship had its designer code. The bride walked the aisle accompanied by the groom’s mother who was celebrating her as per Nigerian culture and also two dancers, gyrated to the late Brenda Fassie song “Nomakanjani”. Typical of the African set up. <img class="size-full wp-image-594923" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/0901-1-1-IMG-3452-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/0901-1-1-IMG-3452-1.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/0901-1-1-IMG-3452-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Nigerian delegation led by Davido (second from left) She was dressed in the Nigerian style and according to a close source, the garment was made from one of the most expensive materials in the West African country and as per the culture, it is usually worn by the chief. Daniella was showered with money as she danced with her husband. In an interview, the coordinator of the event, Caroline Mlambo, said she was happy everything went according to script. “We had a theme and planner instructions we were following and we wanted to stick to the plan, no loopholes. It was strictly by invitation. “Guests were given the lobola cloth to design their own attire,” she said. “We had Western dishes. I can’t disclose how the celebration was worth but I am happy that it was the bride and groom’s wish. “The after-party was also strictly by invitation.” The groom’s long-time friend and musician Davido said he was happy to be in Zimbabwe for the first time for a private function not a public concert. “I call the groom Tiny, because we grew up together and I am happy for him that he has found Daniella. “I wish them success and happy, peace and loving marriage,” said the “Skelewu” hit-maker. <img class="size-full wp-image-594924" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Untitled-17.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Untitled-17.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Untitled-17-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The cake “I am here for their celebrations and not for a concert. I am going to entertain those selected at the private party.

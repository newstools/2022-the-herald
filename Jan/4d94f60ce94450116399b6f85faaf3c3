The Herald LONDON. — Newcastle United have reportedly made contact with fellow English Premiership football club Arsenal over a stunning deal for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Aubameyang has been one of Arsenal’s most influential players since arriving in the English Premier League in 2018, scoring 92 goals in 163 appearances and helping the club win the FA Cup and reach the Europa League final. But the 32-year-old may have played his last game for the Gunners after being stripped of the captaincy following a ‘’disciplinary breach’’. Aubameyang has not featured for Arsenal since losing the captain’s armband and is ready to leave the Emirates Stadium, with a move to France raised as a possibility. But Aubameyang is also attracting interest from an English club, with Newcastle hoping to bring the Gabon striker to St James’ Park as they bid to avoid relegation. The Daily Mirror say Newcastle are in talks with Arsenal over an initial loan deal, with a view to a £20m deal at the end of the season. — Metro.

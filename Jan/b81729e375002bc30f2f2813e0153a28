The Herald Crime Reporter A 75-year-old Zaka man was fatally assaulted by his nephew early Sunday morning following an altercation over alleged witchcraft, as violent deaths continue to increase countrywide. Hakufiwi Musiiwa was attacked at around 5am, allegedly by Norman Mutakayi (36) who wanted to force his uncle to consult a prophet. Police said when Musiiwa refused, Mutakayi attacked him by striking his ribs, hands and legs with a wooden log and he sustained serious injuries. He later died after being forced to walk for about 10km. Mutakayi has since gone into hiding and police have asked anyone with information on his whereabouts to tell their nearest police station. Violent deaths have been on the increase countrywide and recently national police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi urged the public to respect the sanctity of human life.

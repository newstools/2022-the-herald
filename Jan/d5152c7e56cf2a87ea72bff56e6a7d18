The Herald YAOUNDE. — Cameroon wrapped up their Group A campaign at the Total Energies Africa Cup of Nations with a 1-1 draw against Cape Verde at the Olembe Stadium in Yaounde yesterday evening. The result, secured by goals from Vincent Aboubakar and Garry Rodrigues, sees the Indomitable Lions miss out on a 100 per cent record but still finish top of the group, while the Blue Sharks came home in third and will have to wait to see if they advance into the round of 16 as one of the top-ranked third-place teams. Cameroon created some early pressure and were close to a spectacular opener in the 17th minute when Collins Fai’s deflected cross from the right flank fell for Vincent Aboubakar, who sent a volleyed effort just off target from the edge of the penalty area. The Cameroon number 17 was in action again on 33 minutes, holding off a defender before turning and unleashing a long-range grass-cutter which looked destined for the bottom corner but was tipped away for a corner kick by Cape Verde goalkeeper Vozinha. For Aboubakar it was a case of third time lucky, as he broke the deadlock on 39 minutes: an Indomitable Lions free kick was only half cleared by the Blue Sharks defence and the striker latched onto the loose ball and drove a low, left-footed shot into the back of the net to put the hosts in control. Cape Verde responded well to going behind and created some significant pressure leading into half-time, but Cameroon were able to hold out and ensure they enjoyed a one-goal advantage at the interval. — Supersport.

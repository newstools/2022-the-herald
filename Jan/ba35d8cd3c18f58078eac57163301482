The Herald SYDNEY. — Novak Djokovic has been warned that he could be turned away upon his arrival in Australia as the saga over his participation at the opening Grand Slam of the year took yet another twist. The world number one tennis player — who refuses to reveal his vaccination status — is on his way to Australia to compete at this month’s Australian Open after receiving a medical exemption. Djokovic’s application was assessed by two independent panels of experts assembled by Tennis Australia and the Victoria Government and was said to have met conditions set out by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. But Australia’s Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews released a statement yesterday suggesting that border authorities could still step in just hours before the Serbian superstar is expected to land in Australia. The Acting Australian Border Force Commissioner is also looking into an “issue” with Djokovic’s travel declaration, according to ABC. “Any individual seeking to enter Australia must comply with our strict border requirements,” Andrews said in a statement. “While the Victorian government and Tennis Australia may permit a non-vaccinated player to compete in the Australian Open, it is the Commonwealth Government that will enforce our requirements at the Australian border. “Since 15 December 2021 fully vaccinated eligible visa holders can travel to Australia without needing to apply for a travel exemption, and enter eligible states and territories quarantine free. “If an arriving individual is not vaccinated, they must provide acceptable proof that they cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons to be able to access the same travel arrangement as fully vaccinated travellers.’’ — Insidethegames.com

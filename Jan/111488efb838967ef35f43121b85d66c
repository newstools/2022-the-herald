The Government has started rehabilitating access roads to chiefs’ homesteads countrywide to improve accessibility to traditional leaders as well as enhance their dignity and development in communities. The Chiefs’ Access Road Rehabilitation Programme is being implemented through the Emergency Road Rehabilitation Programme 2 (ERRP 2) and is part of the Government’s Devolution and Decentralisation agenda. Under the ERRP2, Government has rehabilitated roads in the country’s cities and towns. The District Development Fund (DDF) will rehabilitate the roads. Minister of State for Presidential Affairs in-charge of Implementation and Monitoring of Government Projects Dr Joram Gumbo will today launch the Matabeleland North chapter of the programme in Siachilaba, Binga where he will hand over a grader to DDF to kick-start works. He will be accompanied by Matabeleland North Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Richard Moyo, president of the Chiefs’ Council Chief Fortune Charumbira, other chiefs from the province and Government officials. Minister Moyo yesterday said road infrastructure and access to key services such as clean water, health and education are key to the needs of traditional leaders and their communities. This will enhance growth through development of other projects, he said. Senator Chief Siansali of Binga said chiefs are a critical institution of Government as they provide a link to all Ministries and agencies.

ZIMBABWE Motorsport president, Ralph Stead, has said efforts are underway to ensure the return of drag racing under safe conditions in the country. Drag racing has become popular for motorsport enthusiasts in the country but this year it has been omitted on the calendar of events. Stead said there are a number of challenges they have been facing in terms of staging drag racing at Donnybrook Park Raceway in Harare and they needed to attend to those first for the smooth running of the events.  He noted that Covid-19 also presented its own challenges, which complicated the situation. However, Stead said they are working on bringing the event back under conducive conditions for both participants and spectators. “As stated, the sport was hugely popular with both competitors and spectators.  This resulted in crowds that became difficult to manage. In addition, the speeds that were being reached were becoming a safety concern. “With these points in mind, it was agreed that relevant steps had (to) be taken to address the potential safety issues. “New spectator fences were erected and then stolen before they were used! Covid subsequently created its own problems. “Currently, we are putting together a new group of enthusiasts to address the above problems and resume drag racing. It will not be a quick-fix as the safety issues have to be dealt with and financing sought to cover the costs of implementing the safety programme. “Please bear with us — drag racing will return and should be bigger and better. Motorsport Zimbabwe has already sourced the new timing equipment!” As the new season takes off, the national association will be hoping for a better year building on the progress made last year in terms of returning to competition after some disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The previous season concluded with the Zimbabwe Summer Series held in December at the home of local motorsport — Donnybrook Park Raceway.

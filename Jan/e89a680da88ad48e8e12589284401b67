The Herald MANCHESTER. — As his Manchester City teammates faced Swindon Town in the FA Cup third round, Benjamin Mendy departed Strange ways prison on Friday night. The France international defender left after being granted bail on Friday afternoon. The suspended City defender is accused of seven counts of rape and one count of sexual assault and will stand trial on January 24. Mendy’s lawyer has denied the charges levelled against the footballer, which relate to five accusers and alleged incidents between the period of October 2020 and August 2021. The Frenchman, who resides in Prestbury, Cheshire, has been in custody since August 26 and was previously denied bail on three occasions. But Judge Patrick Thompson granted him bail on Friday and confirmed that Mendy will be subject to stringent conditions before the trial proper starts in six or seven months. The 27-year-old has been forced to surrender his passport. He must also live at his home address and make no contact with complainants. Mendy was also warned by Judge Thompson that a warrant will be issued for his arrest if he does not appear in court on the date set. Mendy was previously behind bars at HMP Altcourse in Liverpool but was moved to a top-security prison — HMP Manchester, more commonly known as Strangeways — before Christmas amid fears over his safety. — The Mirror.

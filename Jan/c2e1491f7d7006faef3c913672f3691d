The Herald Nyore Madzianike Senior Court Reporter Chief Justice Luke Malaba has today officially opened the 2022 legal year where he delivered the State of the Judiciary address indicating that the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) lost 88 members of staff including 18 magistrates because of poor remuneration.  In his address, Chief Justice Malaba urged the Government to constantly review the salaries of members of the JSC to curtail the continued loss of manpower due to low salaries.  He said courts failed to perform to the optimal level because of the Covid-19 induced national lockdowns that saw the downsizing of court operations.  He said the case backlogs increased in various courts, which prompted the JSC to implement digitisation of court operations.

The Herald Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter HOSTS Sri Lanka have been forced to drop three players that tested positive for Covid-19 in the squad that is set to play Zimbabwe in a One Day International Series that begins this weekend. Avishka Fernando, Janith Liyanage and Kamil Mishara have been omitted in the strong 17-member squad after returning positive tests. Vice-captain Dhananjaya De Silva will also miss the series because he is on paternity leave while Lahiru Kumara and Kalana Perera ‘have not fulfilled the fitness standards.’ Five new players were roped into the squad as replacements and these are Dinesh Chandimal, Kusal Mendis, Nuwan Pradeep, Shiran Fernando and Kamindu Mendis. Fernando is one of the three uncapped pacers in the squad for the white-ball games along with Nuwan Thushara and Chamika Gunasekara.

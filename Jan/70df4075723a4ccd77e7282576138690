The Herald MELBOURNE. — Spanish superstar Rafael Nadal’s Australian Open tennis tournament preparations remain on track after he beat American Maxime Cressy 7-6 (8/6), 6-3 in the final of the Melbourne Summer Set on Sunday. Nadal decided to play the lower level tournament to get some match practice after missing much of 2021 with injury and Covid-19. He has not been totally fluent last week and was pushed hard by the American qualifier, but Nadal had too much experience for the 24-year-old serve-volleyer. It was Nadal’s 89th title on the ATP tour and the win ensures he has won at least one singles crown every year for the past 19 years. Nadal said that, while he was not in perfect shape, he was happy with his form so far. “Exactly where I would like to be is being 100 per cent healthy from last year, playing until the end of the season, and with not having come back after five, six months away from competition,” he said. “So of course I am not exactly the place that I want to be. “But I am very happy. If we put everything together and analyse all the things that I went through the last five months, including the Covid, of course I am happy. — AFP

The Herald GWERU- The Gweru City Council will on Tuesday hold tightly-contested mayoral elections to replace Josiah Makombe, who fell victim to infighting in the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), and was recalled from the post. He was recalled from the position by Doughlas Mwonzora, who dislodged Nelson Chamisa as the authentic leader of the party. Council sources said four councillors, including deputy mayor Cleopas Shiri, were expected to throw their hats in the ring for the top municipal job. Former Gweru mayor Hamutendi Kombayi, a flamboyant businessman, is also in the running for the job. Mwonzora’s MDC faction purged out hundreds of legislators and councillors aligned to Chamisa after he took control of the MDC party
following a Supreme Court ruling. As a result, more than a hundred by-elections for the vacant parliamentary and council seats have been called for March. –

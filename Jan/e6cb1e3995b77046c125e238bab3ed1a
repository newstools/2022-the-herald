The Herald LONDON.  — While Manchester City carried their winning form into 2022, the equally familiar debate around VAR controversy also continued in the first game of the new year. Arsenal assistant manager Albert Stuivenberg and goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale called for more consistency in referees going to the pitchside monitor after the 2-1 defeat by English Premiership football leaders City on Saturday. The hosts thought referee Stuart Attwell should have viewed the monitor after Martin Odegaard went down in a challenge with City goalkeeper Ederson in the first half. A check took place but Attwell was not told to consult the screen because VAR could not definitively say that Ederson did not get a touch on the ball. Instead, Attwell stayed with the on-field decision and awarded a corner. After waving away a foul by Granit Xhaka on Bernardo Silva after the break, Attwell was referred to the monitor and overturned his initial decision to award a penalty. — BBC Sport.

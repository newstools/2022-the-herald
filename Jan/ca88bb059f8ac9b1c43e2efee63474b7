The Herald Takawira Dapi Arts Correspondent Orchestra Dendera Kings boss, Suluman Chimbetu has recorded a collaboration with German-based hip-hop artiste, Metaphysics. The song was played at Sulu’s show at Barauge Club at the weekend. “My name is Metaphysics, a Zimbabwean rap artiste currently based in Germany. I am back home reviving the 30 year anniversary of A Peace of Ebony, which is one of the pioneer Zimbabwean Rap groups. “We have already finished a project that we featured the late Chiwoniso Maraire’s daughter, Chengeto and we have also done a collaboration with Suluman Chimbetu called ‘Temptation’. “We also collaborated with the Jembe Monkeys as we still look forward to collaborating with more artistes willing to celebrate our 30 years of existence as Peace of Ebony rap band from Zimbabwe” said Metaphysics. He paid condolences to the fallen music giant, Zex Manatsa. “Its a very sad case that we have yet again lost another brilliant artiste, Zex Manatsa. “For those of you who are musically inclined, you will know that in Zimbabwe, we only had a few legends, and Zex Manatsa as one of them. “It is very unfortunate that over the years he had disappeared from the music scene.  We salute our legends as we honour them for paving the way that most of us are following today. “Brother Zex Manatsa, thank you for your music and inspiring us, we are still here and promise to continue with your legacy and honestly promise to keep on making music in your honour and in your name,” said Metaphysics.

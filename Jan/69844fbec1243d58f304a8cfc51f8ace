“The incident occurred on January 7, 2022 around midnight, where Andrias Vannard a supervisor at the farm heard some gunshots and he awakened Sean Saywood before teaming up with other security guards. “They proceeded in the direction of the gunshots and suddenly they saw a torchlight from a slow-moving vehicle in the game park. It is alleged that Mr Saywood then fired warning shots in the air and when the poachers realised that they were cornered, they sped off but the driver lost control of the vehicle and veered off the road and landed in a ditch. <img class="size-full wp-image-595109 aligncenter" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-11-at-11.15.09-2.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-11-at-11.15.09-2.jpeg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-11-at-11.15.09-2-360x200.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />

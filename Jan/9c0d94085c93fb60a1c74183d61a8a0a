The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Rugby Union have passed their condolences to the family of Eric “Wishbone” Caldecourt, a long-serving rugby official who died on Wednesday night. In a statement, ZRU said they were saddened by the passing on of Caldecourt who served the sport with distinction. “Wishborne”, as Caldecourt was affectionately known in local rugby circles, held so many positions during his illustrious career that lasted for over six decades. “The Zimbabwean Rugby Union and Zimbabwe Rugby Referees Society are sad to announce the untimely death of one of the longest serving rugby officials. “He served rugby for 68 years,’’ ZRU said in their statement. Caldecourt joined Gweru Rugby Club in 1953 as a team’s hooker before he moved to Harare (then Salisbury) where he joined the Mashonaland Rugby Referees Society in 1963. He has been part of the Referees Association ever since. The referee also served as an administrator where he held several administrative positions such as chairman of Mashonaland Rugby Referees Society, secretary and referee selector. He also served as president of the Rugby Referees Society as well as a trustee when he sat on the board from 1986-1991. ZRU said rugby was part of Caldecourt’s life and very passionate about the sport. “Rugby gave him passion and purpose, a passion he shared with family and the rugby referees’ community. “Caldecourt coached a lot of top level referees and had continued to do duty on the sidelines as a referees’ coach or assistant referee. He is arguably the longest serving rugby match official in the world,’’ ZRU stated. Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe women sevens side the Lady Cheetahs are expected to troop into camp today ahead of their tour of Lesotho. The Lady Cheetahs will leave the country next Saturday.

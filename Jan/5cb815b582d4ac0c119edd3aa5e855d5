The Herald Luxury fashion brand Gucci has come under fire for using real tigers in an advertising campaign ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday that starts on February 1. The campaign was launched earlier this month to celebrate the 2022 Year of the Tiger according to the Chinese zodiac. Animal rights groups have called Gucci out for using wild animals in its campaign. World Animal Protection US said the campaign “exploits captive tigers to sell fashion” and is “misguided.” “More tigers live in captivity in the US than remain in the wild,” said the organisation in a post. “Hunting, habitat destruction, and the climate crisis coupled with their popularity as ‘pets’ has pushed tigers to the brink of extinction.” China’s Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation also protested against the move in a post on microblog Weibo. “We have no objection to the filming of wild animals in natural landscapes if it’s within animal ethics,” the foundation said. But filming the tigers for its commercial use violated “business ethics” and encouraged illegal hunting and the trading of endangered animals, said the foundation. — BusinessInsider.

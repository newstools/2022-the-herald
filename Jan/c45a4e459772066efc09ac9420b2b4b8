The Herald George Maponga in Masvingo The Masvingo Civil Protection Committee (CPU) has ordered the immediate dispatching of awareness teams to warn communities downstream of Tugwi-Mukosi Dam in southern Chivi of flooding prospects after the country’s largest interior dam spilled on Sunday morning.  The giant dam with a full capacity of 1,8 billion cubic meters spilled for the second time since its inauguration in the wake of heavy rains that have been pounding the catchment.  The spilling precipitated fears of a humanitarian crisis spawned by floods downstream of the dam in Tugwi River which is also a tributary of Runde.  Masvingo Civil Protection Committee chair and the secretary for provincial Affairs and Devolution Mr Jefter Sakupwanya says ZINWA has been mandated to deploy awareness teams downstream of the huge reservoir to urge communities to be on alert.  He further disclosed that the provincial civil protection committee also remained on High alert in case the situation spirals out of control.  This comes as Chiredzi district development coordinator Mr Lovemore Chisema has already engaged traditional leaders and political leaders in his district to raise awareness, especially to villagers staying close to Runde and Tugwi Rivers about the increase in water levels owing to the spilling.  Mr Chiseman urged those who get marooned to immediately get in touch with his office for assistance.  Tugwi-Mukosi Dam first spilled in January last year following its commissioning in May 2017.

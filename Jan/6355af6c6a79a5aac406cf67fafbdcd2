The Herald Ellina Mhlanga Sports Reporter THE African Union Sports Council Region Five Regional Annual Sport Awards (RASA) are expected to return next year as sporting activities have now resumed. The awards were suspended due to the Covid-19 that affected the sporting calendar in 2020 and 2021, with limited competitions in some instances. However, there has been some progress with more sporting activities now back. AUSC Region Five chief executive, Stanley Mutoya, confirmed the awards will be back in 2023. “The awards are only reverting in 2023 because what we realised was that yes in 2021 there were Olympic Games but that’s it, the Olympic Games and the Region Five Games that we had. “So we are hoping that sport is slowly resuming and we will allow that to happen,” said Mutoya. The awards are held to recognise, reward and celebrate the Region’s sportspersons for iconic and meritorious service in sport. The awards are a culmination of all the member countries’ national awards. Winners of the member countries’ awards automatically become the nominees on the 11 categories of RASA. Zimbabweans that have previously won the regional awards include motocross rider Tanya Muzinda and wheelchair athlete Elford Moyo.

The Herald LONDON. — Diego Costa bid farewell to Atletico Mineiro as speculation mounts that he could be on his way to English Premiership football club Arsenal. The striker (33) is available on a free transfer after terminating his contract with the Brazilian side. The Spanish international striker has held informal talks with several clubs — including the Gunners. After his departure was confirmed, Costa wrote on Instagram: “Today, officially, I say goodbye to Atletico. “I would like to thank all Massa Atleticana for all the support and affection I received from the first to the last day. Thank you so much for being part of my childhood dream of playing in Brazilian football and winning titles. “I would also like to express my gratitude to the entire technical staff, medical department, employees and especially to my teammates who helped me daily, always doing everything to make me feel comfortable. “The feeling that remains is gratitude to all of you Athleticans. Thank you and I wish you all the success in the world!!!” Spanish La Liga side Cadiz, Brazilian clubs Corinthians and Sao Paolo are also believed to be interested in Costa along with Arsenal. Costa only joined Atletico Mineiro last summer but could be ready for a return to Europe. Costa loved scoring against the Gunners during his Chelsea career, with a stunning record of six goals and five wins in six appearances against the north Londoners. — The Sun

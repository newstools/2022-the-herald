The Herald Crime Reporter A 32-year-old Harare woman has accused a self-styled prophet operating in Harare and Chegutu of drugging and raping her twice in 2017 and 2019 while she was seeking help. The matter was only reported to police on Wednesday in Harare after the woman told others last month. The suspect has since been arrested and investigations are still in progress. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said the police encouraged the public to report cases of assault to the police as soon as possible after the attacks. This would help investigations a great deal. The woman accused the prophet of putting an intoxicating substance into a raspberry drink, made her drink it and then raped her. In the second incident he took advantage of the absence of the woman’s husband and raped her once.

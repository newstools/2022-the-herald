The Herald HOBART. – Travis Head scored a magnificent century to put Australia in command at stumps on the first day of the fifth and final Ashes Test cricket against England as rain forced an early close in Hobart yesterday. At the close of play, Australia were 241-6, with Alex Carey on 10 and Mitchell Starc on zero after being sent in by English captain Joe Root. Only 7.3 overs were possible in the night session, with a persistent misty rain falling on the ground. Head came to the crease with Australia reeling at 12-3, but counter-attacked brilliantly to reach his fourth test century in just 112 balls, with 12 boundaries. However, one ball after reaching his hundred in the day-night match, he chipped Chris Woakes to mid-off, where Ollie Robinson — who bowled only one over in the twilight session due to back soreness — took a simple catch. It was Head’s second century of the series, a result he credited to a new attitude. “I’ve definitely come into the series more relaxed,” he said. “I’ve definitely come into the series with an attitude and an expectation of what is required, and I’ve been able to go out and express myself in the manner as I see fit. “It’s nice to contribute as I have been.” Head’s 101 was a superb response to a much-changed England’s complete dominance in the first 10 overs. Root won the toss and sent the hosts in to bat in overcast conditions and on a real green-top of a wicket. England, who have already lost the series, had Australia on the ropes at 12-3 after 10 overs, with Stuart Broad and Robinson almost unplayable in perfect bowling conditions. They removed David Warner and Steve Smith for ducks and Usman Khawaja for six, and should have had Marnus Labuschagne, who was dropped by Zak Crawley, for no score. However, the game swung back towards Australia when Head and Labuschagne launched a revival, attacking change bowlers Mark Wood and Woakes. – AFP.

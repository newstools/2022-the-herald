A five year old boy from Zongoro village under Chief Mukota was killed by a crocodile while playing in Mazowe River last week while his mother and sister were washing clothes a few metres away. Shadreck July had gone to the river with his mother Ndaizivei Rabu (39) and his sister Nyasha around 1pm. As Ms Rabu saw the attack she shouted for help and nearby villagers rushed up and frightened the crocodile away but they could not retrieve the boy’s body which had drifted to where current was fast. They reported the matter to Nyamapanda Police Station whose Sub Aqua Unit failed to retrieve the body because of the turbulence. Some of the boy’s remains were only found two days after the attack. Police spokesperson for Mashonaland East Province Inspector Simon Chazovachiyi said the river’s high velocity and turbulence made it impossible to retrieve the body but intestines believed to be from the boy were recovered later by the boy’s father. “The remains were taken to Kotwa hospital for post mortem. We urge parents not to leave children near water bodies as they risk drowning or being attacked by crocodiles,” said Insp Chazovachiyi.

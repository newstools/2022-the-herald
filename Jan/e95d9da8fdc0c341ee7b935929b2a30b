The Herald BAFOUSSAM. — Senegal will square off with Cape Verde in the 2021 African Cup of Nations Last 16 match at the Stade Omnisports de Bafoussam in Cameroon today. Kick-off is at 6pm. The Lions of Teranga progressed to the knock-out phase as Group B winners and they remain the strong favourites to win this year’s tournament. Having failed to score in their last two matches, Senegal’s key attackers Sadio Mane and Boulaya Dia will be under pressure to find the back of the net against Cape Verde. Aliou Cisse, the Senegal head coach, is looking forward to facing their WAFU rivals, Cape Verde and he knows what to expect from the Blue Sharks. “We are ready, we worked well on Friday the most decisive session of the week. We worked on the power, yesterday we worked well,” Cisse told the media. “We were able to take advantage of our entire squad to make it two very interesting sessions. Yes, we know Cape Verde. I think in the last few years we must have played them four or even five times. “The last time we played them was in June, of course, it was a friendly match but it was quite a contested . . . it’s a derby, a very good team, they are not in the last 16 by chance,” he added. “A team that we respect, the proximity of the two countries gives even more flavour to this match.” Meanwhile, Cape Verde reached the knock-out phase for the second time in the history of the AFCON finals as one of the four best third-placed teams having finished third in Group A.

The Herald THE Zimbabwe women’s cricket team star Loryn Phiri has been recognised for her sterling run of form for the national team last year after being named in the International Cricket Council (ICC) Women’s T20I Team of the Year. The 23 year-old off spinner and middle order batsman was one of the stand-out players for the Lady Chevrons in 2021. Phiri played nine T20I matches for Zimbabwe, and claimed a stunning 16 wickets, including best figures of 5/6. Her bowling average stood at a stunning 7.18. England’s Nat Sciver has been named the captain of the side while Amy Jones will be donning the wicket-keeping gloves. Opening batter Smriti Mandana is the only Indian player named in the XI, while multiple players from England have been named in the line-up. Tammy Beaumont’s reliable presence at the top of the order helped England off to steady starts regularly. She played nine matches and amassed 303 runs at an average of 33.66, including three fifties. Danni Wyatt, Beaumont’s partner in crime at the top of the order, enjoyed an equally good time in 2021. Wyatt amassed 252 runs in nine matches, at an average of 31.50. While Beaumont was a solid presence at one end, Wyatt took the attack to the bowlers, as her strike rate of 133.33 suggests.

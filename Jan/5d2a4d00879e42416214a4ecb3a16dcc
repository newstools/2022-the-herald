WEST Property Zimbabwe has donated a brand new kit to the Zimbabwe Republic Police Support Unit’s Volleyball Club. The club is set to leave for the Confederation of African Volleyball (CAVB) Zone 6 Senior Volleyball Clubs Championships which are set to run from January 8 to 16 in Maputo, Mozambique. Speaking during the ceremony, the company’s finance manager, Simbarashe Kadye, said his company pride itself in supporting women and the communities that they do business in. “Even more important is an opportunity to support a section of our society whose sole mandate is the protection and security of our communities day in and out — the police. “It is with great pleasure that I present to the ZRP women’s volleyball team these uniforms on behalf of West Property Zimbabwe. We say go well to Mozambique, play well and fly the Zimbabwean flag high making us all proud,” he said. Receiving the kit, the club’s secretary-general, Thomas Mangwiro, said he was grateful for the donation as it will go a long way in motivating the players. “This donation is a (morale) booster to the team as we leave for the tournament and we hope we will raise the country’s flag high,’’ Mangwiro said.

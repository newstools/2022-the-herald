The Herald US President Joe Biden yesterday re-tested positive for Covid-19, just days after the White House said he had been given the all-clear to leave isolation, in a rare case of “rebound” following treatment with an anti-viral drug. White House physician Dr Kevin O’Connor said in a letter that Biden “has experienced no re-emergence of symptoms, and continues to feel quite well.” O’Connor said “there is no reason to re-initiate treatment at this time.” In accordance with Centres for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, Biden will re-enter isolation for at least five days. He will isolate at the White House until he tests negative. The agency says most rebound cases remain mild and that severe disease during that period has not been reported. Just as when Biden first tested positive, the White House sought to show he was still working. He sent out a picture of himself masked and tie-less on Twitter, which showed him signing a declaration that added individual assistance for flood survivors in Kentucky. Biden followed up by tweeting out a 12-second video of him on a White House balcony with his dog, Commander. “I’m feeling fine, everything is good,” said Biden, a pair of aviator sunglasses in his hand. “But Commander and I got a little work to do.” — Euronews

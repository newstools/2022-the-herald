The Herald Blessings Chidakwa Arts Reporter Mark Ngwazi’s latest album, Nyaradzo Yababa, is riding high, and those who thought he was a fluke are starting to re-consider their views. The album even divided opinions in the country, with others doubting its impact based on the timing of release when sungura maestro Alick Macheso had just released his album a week earlier. Some actually had the tenacity and audacity to quickly compare Ngwazi with Macheso. Whatever the case, Ngwazi is probably the man-of-the-moment, of course backed by the achievements being registered by his latest album. on the Radio Zimbabwe top 20 chats, Ngwazi was on number one with his hit song “Nyaradzo yaBaba” taken off his new album, while Macheso was trailing him behind with “Makazviwanepi” from his own new album. Facts being facts, Macheso is a sungura doyen and it will be an insult to compare him with Ngwazi, but when comparing their latest albums, Ngwazi, the man from Njanja in Mashonaland East province seems to have taken the hearts of many sungura fans this time around. On National FM top 20 charts as compiled by Soneni Sibanda as at July 30, 2022, Ngwazi was also sitting on the top position, this time with the song “Vakadzi”. The same goes for Diamond FM in Mutare and Star FM where Ngwazi’s album was endorsed by his growing fan base.

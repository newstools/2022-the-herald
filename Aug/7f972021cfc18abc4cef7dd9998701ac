The Herald Shikhar Dhawan will continue to lead India in the ODI cricket series against Zimbabwe after leading India to a 3-0 series whitewash against West Indies earlier last month. Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah and Rishabh Pant were notable absentees in India’s 15-member ODI cricket squad named for the tour of Zimbabwe. Hardik Pandya and Mohammad Shami were also missing from the list announced on Saturday. Washington Sundar made a return to the squad after recovering from injury and recently appearing in county cricket while Rahul Tripathi was added to the mix. Shubman Gill, who won the Player of the Series in the West Indies ODIs, retained his spot, as did Sanju Samson. Ishan Kishan and Sanju Samson are the wicketkeeping options in the squad. Seamer Deepak Chahar and spinner Kuldeep Yadav recovered from injuries to feature in India’s one-day squad for the three-match one-day international (ODI) series scheduled to take place in Zimbabwe this month. India rested several frontline players, including captain Sharma and batsman Kohli for the matches which will be played in Harare on August 18, 20 and 22. Opener Shikhar Dhawan will lead the 15-member squad which includes uncapped batsman Rahul Tripathi. Dhawan led India to a 3-0 ODI series win against West Indies on Wednesday. Chahar spent nearly six months on the sidelines during which he also missed the Indian Premier League. Left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep has recovered from a wrist injury to return to the side but batsman KL Rahul, who underwent a sports hernia surgery and then tested positive for Covid-19, has been left out. The tour will commence on August 18 with Harare Sports Club set to host all three ODIs.

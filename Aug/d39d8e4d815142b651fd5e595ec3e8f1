The Herald LONDON. — Luke Donald has been confirmed as Henrik Stenson’s replacement to captain Europe’s 2023 Ryder Cup golf team in Italy. Stenson was initially appointed Ryder Cup captain in March, only to be stripped of the role last month after electing to join several of his former Ryder Cup team-mates in signing up for the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Invitational Series. Donald has featured in four winning Ryder Cup teams and served as a vice-captain for the last two editions of the biennial contest, with the former world No. 1 now given the task of trying to regain the trophy for Europe on home soil. “I am incredibly proud to be named European Ryder Cup captain for 2023,” Donald said. “It is truly one of the greatest honours that can be bestowed upon a golfer, to lead a team of your peers and be an ambassador for an entire continent. “I feel extremely privileged to have been given that responsibility and it is a responsibility I do not take lightly. Some of my best experiences in golf have been in the Ryder Cup and I would not swap those for anything. It is an event like no other and I cannot wait to create more special memories in Italy next year. “I love everything the Ryder Cup embodies, from the camaraderie and companionship of being part of a team, to the history of the contest, but most of all playing for something bigger than yourself.” Marco Simone Golf and Country Club on the outskirts of Rome will host the event from September 29-October 1 next year, live on Sky Sports’ dedicated Ryder Cup channel, where Europe will be looking to avenge their record-breaking 19-9 loss at Whistling Straits in 2020. — Sky Sports

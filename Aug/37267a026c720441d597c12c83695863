The Herald Senior Court Reporter The State led by Mr Lancelot Mutsokoti, is today expected to respond to an application by two CCC legislators, Job Sikhala and Godfrey Sithole, challenging their placement on remand. They made the application when they appeared at the Harare Magistrates Court yesterday. Sikhala and Sithole are charged with incitement to commit public violence after they allegedly called their followers to cause violence that rocked the Nyatsime area of Chitungwiza, following the death of a resident, Moreblessing Ali. Through their lawyer, Mr Jeremiah Bamu, the duo challenged their placement on remand saying they were not linked to the alleged offence. In the application, Mr Bamu told the court that people have been arrested in connection with the violation and they were not linked to Sikhala and Sithole. He also said Sikhala never posted any video on social media platforms as alleged by the State. Mr Bamu also said that Sikhala did not record any video as alleged by the State. Harare regional magistrate Mr Stanford Mambanje is expected to make a ruling on Friday.

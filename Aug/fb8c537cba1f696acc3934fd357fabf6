The Herald Chief Court Reporter CCC activists who are facing charges of unleashing violence in Nyatsime will remain in custody pending the hearing of their appeal for bail on August 23 after the High Court removed the matter from the roll. Justice Never Katiyo proposed to have all the cases consolidated into one for purposes of bail appeal hearing. The activists were denied bail by the Harare Magistrates Court prompting their lawyers to approach the High Court on appeal. They were arrested recently for allegedly inciting violence to avenge the death of a community member, Moreblessing Ali. It is alleged that they destroyed homes of Zanu PF members in Nyatsime during the memorial service for Ali. The group was arrested at the same time with Zengeza West legislator, Job Sikhala and Chitungwiza North legislator Godfrey Sithole. Ali’s body was discovered dismembered, stuffed in sacks and thrown in a well after she went missing for more than two weeks. The suspected killer, Pius Jamba, was arrested and is remanded in custody awaiting trial.

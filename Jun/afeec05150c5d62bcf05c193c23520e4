The Herald LONDON. — Arsenal have signed the young forward Marquinhos from Brazilian football club São Paulo on a five-year contract for about £3m. The deal, yet to be announced, will see the 19-year-old arrive in north London in time for pre-season after Arsenal fended off competition from elsewhere. Marquinhos is a winger who broke into the São Paolo side last July and has made 41 appearances, mostly from the bench, scoring four times. He has been capped by Brazil up to Under-17 level. Whereas the last Brazilian youngster to have joined Arsenal, Gabriel Martinelli, made an instant impact it is more likely Marquinhos will be loaned out for his first season. But he is tipped for a bright future and Wolves, who were reported last month to have taken legal advice in the belief that they had a watertight pre-contract agreement with the player, are among the other clubs who had hoped to secure him. Marquinhos will not be the most high-profile arrival at Arsenal this summer. They continue to seek a centre-forward, with Gabriel Jesus remaining their primary target, and there is also a desire to strengthen in central midfield. The club confirmed yesterday that Eddie Nketiah was considering the offer of a new contract, which he is expected to sign. Alexandre Lacazette, whose departure was confirmed last week, has completed his return to Lyon on a three-year deal. — The Guardian.

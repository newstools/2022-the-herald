The Herald Senior Court Reporter A woman, who allegedly stole babies in Harare’s city centre and one of the capital’s old suburbs of Mbare in 2013 and 2015 has been nabbed and appeared in court yesterday. Enitor Marumane appeared at the Harare Magistrates Court where detectives applied for her further detention pending investigations into whether she was responsible for other missing babies in the capital. Harare magistrate Mrs Yeukai Dzuda granted the application and allowed for investigations until Thursday when Marumani is expected back in court. She is charged with kidnapping. It is alleged that on June 26, 2013 Marumane met Natasha Chikwanha who was with her baby in Harare’s city centre. Chikwanha then allegedly asked Marumane to help her carry the baby since she was not feeling well. It is said that upon reaching Gulf Complex, Marumane then allegedly vanished with the baby. On June 18, 2015, Martha Ndinodyei was at Mbare Musika Carthouse when she allegedly asked Marumane to help her carry her baby, as she was off-loading some brooms from a truck. Marumane allegedly took the opportunity and disappeared with the baby.

The Herald Ellina Mhlanga Senior Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE national senior netball team coach Ropafadzo Mutsauki is hoping his charges recover from Monday’s defeats at the hands of Malawi and Namibia to focus on their upcoming games. The Gems had a disappointing day on Monday at the ongoing Confederation of Southern Africa Netball Associations (COSANA) Tri-nations Cup in Malawi when they lost both matches, against the hosts and Namibia. Out of three matches, Zimbabwe have just won one. “Two defeats in a day, it was not our day, so we are now trying to adjust to get back into the game because it was difficult. “And Malawi we tried to contain them but they are a bit experienced than us and the gap did show. But the team played very well. If we had put up such a performance against Namibia, they would not have scored as many goals. “Malawi is a bit stronger than us, and they prepared well,” conceded Mutsauki. They are back in action this evening when they play Malawi again in their fourth game at the tournament. Mutsauki said they are looking forward to the match. “Playing against a big team like Malawi, it’s an advantage to us. So our next game against them, our aim is to give them a good run. “There are certain things we are observing, there are things we are learning from the defeats and it’s important. “Every game is important to us, whether it’s a defeat or a win, it’s very important to us because we are there to prepare a very good team, and a winning team. “So far we do not have a team, we keep on fighting to build a very good team,” added Mutsauki. The match starts at 6pm. In the Under-19 games, Zimbabwe are up against Malawi at 4pm.

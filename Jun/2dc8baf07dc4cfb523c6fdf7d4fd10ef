The Herald Court Reporter An electrician at Zimbabwe Fertiliser Company (ZFC) at its Msasa plant in Harare, yesterday appeared in court on allegations of killing a student when he switched on a machine the apprentice student was still working on, resulting in him being crushed and killed. Brian Kunaka appeared at the Harare Magistrates Court charged with culpable homicide, that is through actions the reasonable person would consider unreasonable being responsible for the death even though this was not intended. He was not asked to plead to the charges when he appeared before magistrate, Mrs Yeukai Dzuda, who remanded him to July 7 for routine further remand. It is alleged that on April 22 this year at around 3pm, Kunaka was at ZFC Msasa, where he is employed as an electrician and was in charge of the switchboard room, where all machines in the plant are powered. Kunaka then allegedly switched on a screen rotary machine that the late Godfrey Chipoyera, who was a third year apprenticeship student, was still working on, resulting in him being crushed to death. The allegations are that Kunaka failed to take precautions by physically checking if anyone was working on the machine before switching it on.

The Herald Conrad Mupesa–Mashonaland West Bureau FORMER Mashonaland West Governor Faber Chidarikire was  on Wednesday fined $30 000 for contravening the Firearms Act by leaving a revolver unsecured, enabling a thief to steal it. Chidarikire (75) appeared before Chinhoyi magistrate Mr Langton Ndokera. Prosecuting, Mr Tendai Tapi, told the court that on May 18, Chidarikire left his registered revolver, a Taurus Rifle .357 (serial number 16393) inside his headboard in his bedroom around 8am and headed for other duties at Chinhoyi terminus. The firearm was properly licensed with the Central Firearm Registry under number 129257 expiring on December 1 next year, but gun owners are expected to lock away their weapons securely. Upon returning home around 8pm the same day, Chidarikire realised that someone had broken into his house and stolen the firearm. He filed a report at Chinhoyi Central Police Station and the CID checked out the theft. Chidarikire was accused of failing to properly safeguard his firearm and its four rounds. The gun and the rounds have not been recovered.

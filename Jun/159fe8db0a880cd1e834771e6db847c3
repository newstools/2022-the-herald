The Herald LONDON. — Tottenham have agreed a £25 million fee with Brighton for midfielder Yves Bissouma. Spurs boss Antonio Conte has beaten Arsenal to the punch after identifying Bissouma as a top summer target. The Mali international is regarded as one of the best footballers playing outside the Premier League’s ‘Big Six’. And after entering the final year of his contract, Bissouma is now set to join Spurs for a cut-price fee ahead of a medical this week. Spurs are keen to make midfielder Bissouma their third summer addition following the arrivals of free transfer duo Ivan Perisic and Fraser Forster. Bissouma has just one year left on his contract at the Amex and is now expected to undergo a medical tomorrow. Agreeing personal terms with Bissouma is not expected to be a problem. Mali midfielder Bissouma joined Brighton for around £13m from Lille in 2018 and has caught the eye of a number of Premier League clubs with his all-action displays. Should he complete the move, he will give Antonio Conte another high quality midfield option. Rodrigo Bentancur arrived in January and predominantly partnered Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg for the remainder of the season as Spurs qualified for the Champions League. Conte is also a big fan of Oliver Skipp, whose progress last season was hampered by injury.  — Mailonline

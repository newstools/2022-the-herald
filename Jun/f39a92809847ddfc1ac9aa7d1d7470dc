The Herald Oscar Rusenga in TRIANGLE Triangle United . . . . . . . . . . . .  (0)0 Chicken Inn . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (1)1 A 10-man Chicken Inn reclaimed their position at the summit of Castle Lager Premiership football table when they collected maximum points at Triangle yesterday. A first half penalty by league top scorer Brian Muza was enough to hand Joey Antipas’ team the full set of points in an eventful encounter at Gibbo. The hosts pressed for an early goal and Gamecocks defence were caught unawares in the opening minute but goalkeeper Donovan Bernard was alert to push away Russel Madamombe’s thunderous effort for a corner. Chances were few in the opening exchanges before Muza had a brilliant effort equally matched by Triangle goalkeeper Geoffrey Chitsumba in the 23rd minute. Triangle got the chance of their own from a dead ball situation when Misheck Ngwenya was hacked down just outside the box. Jameson Mukombwe flew his effort well over bar from a very good position in the 24th minute. Muza was menacing with his pace switching wings and eventually won a penalty as he was fouled by Tawanda Chisi with a goal in his sight. Muza dusted himself off to score the match winner in the 34th minute. Chicken Inn had chances to add at least a cushion goal in the second half but Chitsumba was in top form denying Muza in the 66th minute after Triangle was caught on the break. Passmore Bernard and Malvin Whata combined well with slick one-twos but the latter’s tame effort from five yards out was easily collected by Chitsumba in the 70th minute.

The Herald Court Correspondent Land developer Felix Munyaradzi — who was facing allegations of fraud involving a residential stand — yesterday heaved a sigh of relief after the High acquitted him. Munyaradzi was arrested by Special Anti Corruption Unit following a report by Assistant Commissioner Erasmus Makodza  before he was cleared by a team of investigators. When Sacu withdrew the charges against Munyaradzi, the National Prosecuting Authority took over. Aggrieved by the re-emergence of the case, Munyaradzi filed an application for exception to the charges while at the same time challenging the revocation of withdrawal consent by magistrate Taurai Manuwere at the High                                                                                Court. Two High Court judges Justice Tawanda Chitapi and Justice Bhachi-Mzawazi ruled that Manuwere’s decision to revoke the consent was marred by suspicion which prompted them to set it aside. Munyaradzi’s lawyer Charles Warara opposed the revocation of the consent before saying this was akin to directing and giving instructions to the Judiciary. Munyaradzi in his affidavit to the High Court accused Makodza of being behind his arrest.

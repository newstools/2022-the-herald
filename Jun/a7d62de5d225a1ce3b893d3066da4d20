The Herald LONDON. — Harry Maguire has defended under-fire England boss Gareth Southgate after a 4-0 defeat to Hungary, claiming he remains one of the best managers in international football. Maguire, who came on as a late substitute with England 3-0 down at Molineux on Tuesday, says the loss was “unacceptable” but insisted the Three Lions can make a big impact at the World Cup this year. England are facing the threat of Nations League relegation after taking just two points from four Group A3 games, following up draws against Germany and Italy with their heaviest home defeat since a 5-1 hammering by Scotland in 1928. A failure to win any of their four games this month also leaves England on their worst run since June 2014, when they went without a victory in five games during a month which saw them finish bottom of their group at the 2014 World Cup under Roy Hodgson. Hungary also became the first team to score four goals in an away match against England since their historic 6-3 triumph at Wembley in 1953, leading Southgate to come under fire from supporters. Chants of “you don’t know what you’re doing” were aimed at Southgate by home fans during the hammering, but Maguire says he remains the right man to lead the team in Qatar later this year. “Gareth is the most successful England manager since Sir Alf Ramsey in 1966,” the defender told the Sun. “We all can’t wait to work with him and the backroom team again at the World Cup. “His managerial record is as good as anyone currently out there in international football. “There’s no reason why we can’t do really well and our goal is to improve on our previous tournaments and make the country proud. “We deserved more from the first three (Nations League) games, but against Hungary on Tuesday it wasn’t acceptable. — AFP.

The Herald LONDON. — Riyad Mahrez is ready to sign a new long-term deal — and effectively commit the rest of his career to Manchester City. The forward still has a year left on his £160 000-a-week contract. But there are plans to open talks about an extension over the next month. And Mahrez (31) would like to see out the rest of his years at City. The Algerian is settled in Manchester while he and partner Taylor Ward, daughter of former striker Ashley, are expecting their first child this year. Mahrez holds a strong bargaining position, with Gabriel Jesus set for a move to Arsenal and uncertainty over Chelsea target Raheem Sterling’s future. But his priority is landing another three-year deal, with an option for one more after that. City do not want to lose him on a free and are confident terms will be agreed without fuss. Mahrez has been at the Etihad since 2018 after a £60million move from Leicester. He has gone on to score 63 goals in 189 games under Pep Guardiola. And Mahrez has scooped plenty of trophies in that time, including three titles. City have already moved to effectively replace fellow forwards Jesus and Sterling with Erling Haaland and Julian Alvarez. Leeds midfielder Kalvin Phillips is also set to arrive after Fernandinho’s exit. And Guardiola hopes to land Brighton left-back Marc Cucurella too. — The Sun.

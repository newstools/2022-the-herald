The Herald Tendai Rupapa Senior Reporter THE Government of India and its people have donated 950 sewing machines to First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa’s Angel of Hope Foundation in a development tailored to empower local women through skills training and employment creation thus boosting their earnings. Speaking at the handover of the machines to the First Lady at Zimbabwe House yesterday, India’s Minister of State for External and Parliamentary Affairs Mr Vellamvelly Muraleedharan paid tribute to the first lady for her philanthropic works which he said he followed with keen interest. The mother of the nation, who is the country’s health ambassador, is training women and girls in various parts of the country to sew reusable sanitary pads for the benefit of vulnerable groups that cannot access disposable sanitary pads. Recently in Chitungwiza, Dr Mnangagwa donated sewing machines, material and all other accessories to youths following a training in reusable pads making by Angel of Hope. Apart from fostering skills transfer, the project has also largely helped curb cases of juvenile delinquency as the girls are now gainfully engaged with little idle time. The project also helps improve menstrual hygiene, helping some girls who had resorted to managing menstrual flow using unhygienic methods. Besides sanitary making, the girls in Chitungwiza are also sewing clothes for the benefit of disadvantaged children in their communities. <img class="size-full wp-image-621576" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/Untitled-21.f4f.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/Untitled-21.f4f.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/Untitled-21.f4f-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa and Indian Minister of State for External Affair and Parliamentary Affairs Vellamalli Muraleedharan operate one of the sewing machines donated by Indian Government to Angel of Hope Foundation at Zimbabwe House yesterday The First Lady is also donating sewing machines to schools countrywide and offering reusable pad making training to the school children so that no pupil misses school during their menstrual cycle owing to lack of pads.

This is our winter. I know India is not cold this time. I want to thank India in so many ways. Firstly, I want to thank India on behalf of GD Goenka University which conferred an honorary degree to me for the philanthropic work. That is a big honour to me because when you are doing things you do not know that people will be watching. I respect and also thank the university and also the government of India. “Coming to Zimbabwe as an ambassador of health, I want to thank the Government of India for helping us when the Covid-19 pandemic broke out which saw our Government and as a people start receiving this dosage for our people to curb this disease. It also states that the relationship between Zimbabwe and India is a longstanding friendship and we would want to continue in that atmosphere and further ties and also that all the meetings that we had, I hope and trust that they should come to fruition and that’s how development can come in countries and more especially in our country which is a developing country we need a lot of friends and a lot of partners to help us grow our country,” she said. Dr Mnangagwa said the machines could not have come at any better time as they would help her immensely in her empowerment programmes. “The machines that you have brought are going to do a lot of work helping me in the way I discharge my duties. There is a lot of need in the country and sanitary ware to women is what we call a woman. We are training rural and urban women and also school girls who have already started the sewing project and they have got a targeted group,” she said with happiness written all over her face.

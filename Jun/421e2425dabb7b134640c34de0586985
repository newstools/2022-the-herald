The Herald Ellina Mhlanga Senior Sports Reporter IT was a disappointing day for the Gems yesterday when they suffered another defeat at the hands of Malawi as the Confederation of Southern Africa Netball Associations Tri-Nations Cup entered day four at Kuhes Sports Complex in Blantyre, Malawi. The Gems were outclassed 63-34 by the hosts. It has been a disappointing adventure for the Zimbabwe senior netball team that has lost four of the five games they have played so far. Zimbabwe play Namibia today in their last match as the tournament comes to an end. The emphasis has been on assessing the team as part of the preparations for the Netball World Cup qualifier to be staged in August, in South Africa, and based on how the team has fared so far, the technical team still has a lot of work to do. Just like in their previous games, Malawi proved to be too good for the visitors, taking control of the game from the first quarter until the final whistle. Malawi were 14-8 in the opening quarter. By the end of the second quarter, they were leading by 10 points. The third quarter ended 43-23. There wasn’t much change in the fourth quarter and the hosts claimed another victory to remain unbeaten. On the other hand, Zimbabwe’s Under-19 team registered their third win when they beat Namibia 46-36. They are yet to drop a point at the tournament. It was their second game against Namibia at this competition having first met on Sunday.

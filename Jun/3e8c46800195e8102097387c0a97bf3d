The Herald MANCHESTER — Erling Haaland has come home. The Norway striker finalised his move to Manchester City from Borussia Dortmund for 60 million euros (US$63 million) yesterday to seal his return to England, the country of his birth — but the superstar striker is yet to be assigned a shirt number. And fans are convinced the 21-year-old is waiting to nab the No. 9 shirt off Gabriel Jesus. Jesus is expected to leave the Etihad this summer and has been linked with a move to Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham. His impending departure would free up the No. 9 shirt for Haaland, who has worn the number for the last two seasons at Borussia Dortmund and currently dons it for Norway. City though cannot announce Haaland as their new No. 9 with Jesus still at the club. In his unveiling yesterday morning, City said: “Haaland shirts will be made available once his squad number is confirmed in due course”. His father, Alf-Inge, played for City in the English Premier League from 2000-03 and Erling supported the club as a kid. He has posted on social media pictures of himself wearing a City jersey as a young boy. “This is a proud day for me and my family. I have always watched City and have loved doing so in recent seasons,” Haaland said. “You can’t help but admire their style of play — it’s exciting — and they create a lot of chances, which is perfect for a player like me.” Haaland, regarded as one of the world’s top young players along with Kylian Mbappe, is joining on a five-year deal. City activated the release clause in Haaland’s Dortmund contract and looks to be getting a superstar on the cheap. — AFP

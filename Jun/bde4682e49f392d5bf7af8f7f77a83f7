The Herald LONDON. — Bayern Munich have completed the signing of Sadio Mane from Liverpool in a deal worth up to £35m. The 30-year-old has signed a contract with the German Bundesliga football champions until 2025. Bayern will pay Liverpool an initial £27.5m with a further £5m based on appearances, and will pay another £2.5m based on individual and team achievements. The deal eclipses what Liverpool paid for Mane — £31m plus £2.5m in add-ons — with Southampton not getting any additional money. And Mane insists it is “the right time for a challenge’’ after completing his £35.1million move to Bayern Munich from Liverpool yesterday. The star forward arrived in Bavaria on a private jet from Majorca on Tuesday with his advisor Bjorn Bezemer and then went on to Barmherzige Bruder hospital to undergo his medical. Mane has now put pen to paper on a three-year contract worth £250 000-a-week at the Allianz Arena, ending his six-year stay on Merseyside. Speaking for the first time as a Bayern player, Mane said yesterday: ‘’I’m very happy to finally be with FC Bayern in Munich. “We had a lot of talks and I felt the great interest of this big club from the start. So there was no doubt in my mind right from the start. “This is the right time for this challenge. I want to achieve a lot with this club.’’ The Senegal star, who arrived at Anfield from Southampton in 2016 for £34m, played his last match for the Reds in the Champions League final defeat by Real Madrid. Mane hinted before that match in Paris that his future may lie away from Anfield and then confirmed his intention to leave less than 24 hours after the full-time whistle. In a farewell interview with Liverpool, Mane added: “Obviously it is strange — really, really strange — to no longer be a Liverpool player after six years spent at Anfield. — Sky Sports

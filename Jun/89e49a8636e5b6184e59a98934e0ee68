The Herald LONDON. — Cristiano Ronaldo is expected to stay at Manchester United this summer and will report back for pre-season training at the beginning of July, despite reports he is ready to quit the English Premiership football club. Portuguese sports daily Record claim Ronaldo wants to leave after only one season back at Old Trafford as he fears new boss Erik ten Hag does not have the right tools to compete for titles, while he is also said to be frustrated with the club’s transfer window so far. However, it is understood the 37-year-old is expected to return for pre-season preparations once back from his summer holidays, which will be slightly extended due to his involvement with Portugal in their three opening Nations League fixtures in June. A report in Spanish daily AS that Bayern Munich are interested in signing Ronaldo if Robert Lewandowski joins Barcelona is also wide of the mark, according to Sky in Germany. It is understood that Ronaldo does not fit Bayern’s transfer philosophy, while the club are still trying to persuade Lewandowski to see out the final year of his contract despite Barcelona’s €40m (£34.4m) offer for the Poland striker. The first players to report back to United’s Carrington training base on Monday will be those who did not feature in international fixtures this month, while the rest will follow over the course of the following week. Ten Hag confirmed during his introductory press conference at United that Ronaldo is part of his plans for the new season, and said he would contribute “goals” to his side. The star forward returned to Old Trafford last summer, 13 years after leaving for Real Madrid for a then-world record fee, but it did not prove to be the glorious homecoming he had hoped. — Sky Sports.

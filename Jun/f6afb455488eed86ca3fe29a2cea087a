The Herald Prosper Dembedza Court Correspondent The assault case of Tendai Biti continued today with him insisting that it should be referred to the Apex court as his rights are being infringed. He was basing his application on the grounds that he was getting biased coverage. He claimed that the headlines that were being given to this case by The Herald are misleading and biased. Deputy Prosecutor Mr Micheal Reza objected several times to such submissions arguing that Biti was bringing irrelevant grounds in his application. In this application, Biti started by blaming Zanu PF Politiburo member Cde Patrick Chinamasa for causing his arrest. During the previous sittings, Mr Reza told the court that Biti was trying to bring in politics and political names in an assault case. Biti is facing charges of manhandling a Zimbabwean investor Mrs Tatiana Aleshina at the Magistrates Court.

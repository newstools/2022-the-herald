The Herald Freedom Mupanedemo-Midlands Bureau A gang of six robbers wanted for rape, robbery and theft charges has been rounded up in Gweru with the seventh suspect now on the run. Police have since launched a manhunt for the suspect. Some of the victims were raped as part of a superstitious belief that this would make the robbers’ careers in crime successful, a belief proved totally wrong when police busted the gang. At one robbery and mass rape in a Gweru suburb, the suspects force-marched a family into the dining room where they then asked the father to cover his face with a blanket as they raped his wife and children. Midlands provincial police spokesperson Inspector Emmanuel Mahoko said Tafara Mabika (23), Blessing Chikomba (22), both from Mkoba, and Joseph Moyo (22) and Dither Chigondo (26), both from Woodlands, were arrested last Monday. Cleopas Moyo (26) and Charles kupfavira (25) were then arrested on Thursday as police investigations continued. Police are now actively seeking to arrest the outstanding suspect, Lawrence Munyaradzi. “Police managed to recover some of the stolen property and a pistol with a live round, a magazine with 4 rounds some clothes car batteries and cellphones,” said Insp Mahoko. So far the suspects have led the police to nine homes they broke into and stole property. People that fell victims to the robbers and thieves have since been invited to approach Gweru Central Police Station and Nehanda Police Station to assist in identifying property. The property is at Nehanda Police Station. Insp Mahoko said police were also appealing to the public who might have information that may lead to the arrest of Munyaradzi to report at any police station near them.

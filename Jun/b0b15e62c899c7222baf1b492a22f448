The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — The South African Music Awards (SAMAs) and the Recording Industry of South Africa (RiSA) have always gone above and beyond in curating their events, whether it’s a nomination party or the main event itself. In front of a venue in North Riding, Randburg, packed with media, musicians, influencers and other music industry insiders, announcements of the various category nominations were made yesterday in between performances from the likes of TLT, Sjava and MFR Souls. Other artistes in attendance included A-Reece, Mr JazziQ, Profound, Holy Rey, Loki, Shane Eagle and Dr Mr X. After about three hours of proceedings, the main storylines from the afternoon became crystal clear: amapiano is as dominant as ever, Zakes Bantwini is carving a lane of his own and Blxckie just can’t catch a break. After already earning a nod in the Record of the Year (ROTY) category announced last week for “Osama” with Kasango, Zakes leads the way after he bagged an additional six nominations for his album, “Ghetto King” and his two songs, “Imali” with Karyendasoul featuring Nana Atta, and Osama. Amapiano pioneer DJ Maphorisa follows close behind with six nominations, while Mobi Dixon and Msaki have four nominations each. Khanyisile Mthetwa, Brian Temba, Sun-El Musician and Chymamusique earned three nods apiece. The biggest talking point on social media yesterday was how Blxckie only received one nomination. Shishiliza, the artist behind the biggest song so far this year, “Sondela” tweeted his shock at the “snub”. Metro FM Top 40 countdown show host, DJ Shabby, also expressed his surprise, tweeting how he felt Blxckie should have been nominated for Male Artist of the Year. The awards will be presented at a live event to be broadcast on July 31 on SABC1. — IOLNews

The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter SALIF Cheya of Herentals Under-20 managed to score what could probably be the fastest goal in the ZIFA Northern Region Division One Soccer League after they saw off Chinhoyi Stars 5-0 at Motor Action Sports Club on Saturday. Cheya scored after 36 seconds as his team ran riot against Chinhoyi Stars. The Students were the biggest winners at the weekend as the match between the other title-chasing side Golden Eagles and Simba Bhora match was postponed after the death of Barnabas Mushunje. Herentals Under-20 got their first three goals from Cheya, who scored a hat-trick, opening his account after 36 seconds before he added two more goals in the 15th and 24th minute. Their other goals were scored by Fungai Murapa (37th minute) and Jimmy Jimu (47th minute). Herentals Under-20 coach Paul Benza said the win is good for his side as they continue with their chase for the championship. “I am happy with the win. It is one of our biggest wins considering that we were 1-0 winners when the season resumed for the second legs. “The boys are training hard and their efforts are now bearing fruits. We are focused on how we play and do not look much in other teams as it will affect us psychologically,” said Benza.

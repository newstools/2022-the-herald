The Herald ACCRA – A taxi driver in Ghana has been praised for his honesty after returning to the rightful owner 8 400 Ghanaian cedis (US$1 100 )that he found in the back of his car, BBC Pidgin reports. An emotional video of Isaac Ackon giving back the money to a fishmonger has been shared on social media recently. In the video neighbours join the fishmonger in hugging the taxi driver and they can be seen thanking him for the honesty he showed the elderly woman who, they said, had been unable to sleep. Other Ghanaians, including Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia, were also moved and gave Ackon US$2 600 as a reward. Musician KiDi also gave the driver US$660. The former captain of the national football team, Asamoah Gyan requested to meet Ackon. The driver said he returned the money because of his Christian values. He handed it back to the fishmonger after praying in church, local media reported . After ending another day, he was checking through his car when he found a cloth tied over something. The cloth was dirty, like a rag. It smelled of fish. “I wanted to throw it away,” he told African news outlet Fourth Estate.– IOLNews

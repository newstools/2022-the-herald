In his address, President Mnangagwa said infrastructure development such as the civil Registry was in line with what the Second Republic committed to doing, to give good public services to the people, particularly in the rural areas. He said with the advent of digital platforms such as e-passports, cases of corruption in the issuance of documents will now be curtailed.

The Herald Prosper Dembedza Court Correspondent Hip-Hop artist, Desmond Chideme’s estranged wife Dyonne Tafirenyika, yesterday abandoned her police statement as she smuggled new evidence in their domestic violence case. In her initial police statement, Tafirenyika claimed that she was dragged from the ladies’ toilets and assaulted in the parking lot, which is the opposite of what is contained in her statement. When she was questioned in court by Stunner’s lawyer, Dumisani Mtombeni, she said she was assaulted while in the toilet, in the lobby, in the hotel room and lastly in the parking lot. She also claimed that she had video footage of her being assaulted but when asked for it, she told the court that they did not find any footage from the Rainbow Towers Hotel security team. Tafirenyika also told the court that Chideme got violent towards his friends when they tried to restrain him and when was asked why that was not in her witness statement, she said the police might have failed to capture that. One of the witnesses in the case, Donnel Dawson whom Tafirenyika claimed was present when the incident took place, said there was only a misunderstanding and no physical assault. According to the State, Chideme assaulted Tafirenyika at the height of a domestic dispute at Rainbow Towers Hotel in April. The court heard Tafirenyika had refused to give Chideme her mobile phone. Mr Mtombeni said the two were no longer together and the wife had since moved out of their house with her belongings. Meanwhile, Dawson later appeared before the same magistrate facing domestic violence charges after he allegedly assaulted his wife. He pleaded guilty to the charges and the duo would be back in court on Wednesday for continuation of trial and a possible withdrawal of Dawson’s case.

The African Union Sports Council Region 5 Karate Championships were attended by countries like Angola, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwean delegation had 13 athletes (10 females and three males), three officials, two referees and the team manager. Two officials attended a high level international tactical seminar conducted by Seba as one coach attended the Regional Coaching Course where an agreement was signed wherein Seba would conduct a four-day tactical coaching seminar for athletes and coaches in Harare in September 2022. The Zimbabwe National Karate Federation secretary-general, Tirivenyu Mutema, said they feel honoured to have athletes retuning home with medals and the chance given to Rugwete. “We are delighted that our athletes managed to do well despite the challenges they encountered. We would have loved to send more athletes but we had financial challenges which saw us sending a small delegation. “We will, however, get an opportunity next year when we will be the host nation and we can give all the athletes a chance as they are all medal hopefuls,’’ said Mutema.

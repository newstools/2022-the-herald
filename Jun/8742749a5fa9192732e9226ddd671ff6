The Herald LONDON. — The Global Esports Federation (GEF) has announced that the 2025 Global Esports Games will take place in Dubai. The announcement was revealed at the 2022 Global Esports Tour, which commenced at the Dubai World Trade Centre. Dubai will be the fifth host city of the Global Esports Games. In 2021, GEF previously announced Singapore, Istanbul and Riyadh as hosts. It was later revealed that China will host the event in 2024, with the Global Esports Games taking place in the USA in 2026. It was previously revealed that the UAE would host in 2025, with GEF now confirming the exact host city as Dubai. The inaugural edition of the Global Esports Games in Singapore featured Dota 2 and eFootball PES 2021 and Street Fighter V competitions, with players and teams representing their regions. The titles for the competition’s next edition in Instanbul have yet to be revealed. Alongside the Global Esports Games, the GEF also runs the Global Esports Tour, a series of professional esports tournaments staged in cities throughout the year. Most recently the tour concluded a US$250 000 (£206 600) CS:GO tournament, which was won by the Swedish organisation Ninjas in Pyjamas. Paul J. Foster, CEO of the GEF, commented: “We are excited to see the incredible progress since our signing of a Strategic Framework Agreement with Emirates Esports at Expo 2020 Dubai last November, to unlock opportunities and develop esports in the region. “The world will once again unite in Dubai with the city confirmed to host the Global Esports Games in 2025.” Earlier this year, the GEF also announced a partnership with sports, events and talent management company IMG for the inaugural Commonwealth Esports Championships — which ties into the official Commonwealth Games — and the 2022 Global Esports Games. — esportsinsider.com

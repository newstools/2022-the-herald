The Herald FORMER Warriors captain Knowledge Musona managed to scoop the golden boot award in his first season at Saudi Pro League side Al-Tai FC after scoring a goal and providing one in the club’s emphatic 3–0 win over bottom side Al Hazm on the last day of the campaign on Monday. The 32-year-old doubled the scores 14 minutes before full-time after striker Tobias Figueroa have given Al-Tai a first-half lead and would assist the third goal by Mukhtar Ali in the 87th minute as his club finished an impressive sixth in their first season back in the top-flight league. Musona made amends for missing a penalty in first half optional time. Clearly the most outstanding player for Al-Tai, Musona concludes the season with six goals for the club, one better than attacking midfielder Amir Sayoud and striker Figueroa who have five apiece while he also leads the assists column with eight. After making a €300 000 switch from Belgian giants Anderlecht in July last year Musona went on to make 24 appearances for the club that flirted with relegation until the latter part of the season. Al-Tai were making a return to the Pro League for the first time since 2008 and have managed to stay afloat for another season. Musona has also received huge recognition in the Saudi Pro League following the end of the 2021/22 season. The former Warriors captain has been named in the Sofascore’s Saudi Pro League Team of the Season. Musona, who was mostly featured as a central midfielder, made 24 appearances, scoring six goals and assisting eight. The 32-year-old’s final contribution of the campaign saw him netting and creating goals in the 3-0 win over Al-Hazem. The performances saw him included in the Team of the Week five times during the campaign. The recognition is Musona’s most significant honour since arriving in the Middle East last year from Belgian side Anderlecht. Meanwhile, Al Tai finished sixth in the 2021/22 season of the Saudi Pro League. — ZimSportLive/Soccer24

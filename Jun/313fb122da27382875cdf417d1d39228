Speaking at a press conference, Zanu PF’s national Political Commissar Cde Mike Bimha said the symposium will be centred on reserved sectors. He said emphasis will be on taxes and car hire services, retail and wholesale trade, barbershops, hairdressing, employment and advertising agencies, grain milling, bakeries, tobacco grading and packaging, artisanal miners among others. “The party is geared to ensure no one is left behind in economic empowerment programmes,” said Cde Bimha. The need for a revised policy came into effect after it had come to the party’s attention that the amendment to the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act (Chapter 14:33) (IEE Act) contained in the Finance (No 2) Act, 2020 (section 36) may have caused some misconception to the general public, stakeholders and investors in different economic sectors. Economic Empowerment Group president Mr Mike Chimombe said they will take part at the business symposium to ensure no one is left behind in building the economy “The EEG has not changed its core business as a protecting, defending and agitating forum but right now we are moving together with Government policies, that is NDS1 and the Vision 2030, where the issue is that most of our youths, women and the general public, they have not yet seen the full benefits of empowerment. It is therefore important for us to conscientise and advocate for people with ideas so that they get what it is to be Zimbabwe in 2030. We all know the problem of unemployment, therefore we want our youths, women across the country to participate fully in the economic emancipation of every sector so that they get what they deserve and desire,” Mr Chimombe. <img class="size-full wp-image-619464" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/Mike-Chimombe.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/Mike-Chimombe.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/Mike-Chimombe-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Mike Chimombe He said those, who want to venture into small scale mining, farming can access mining and agricultural equipment from EEG. “We are there to support Government programmes. “As EEG we will encompass everyone even those at grass roots level.

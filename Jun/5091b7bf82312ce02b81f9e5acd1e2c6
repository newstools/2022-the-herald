The Herald BEIJING. – A new platform to promote economic and trade cooperation between China and Africa was established in Beijing on Tuesday. The Asia-Africa Innovation Cooperation Centre was set up following President Xi Jinping’s proposal made at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in 2018 to set up a China-Africa center on innovation cooperation to promote innovation and entrepreneurship among young people in China and Africa, according to the Administrative Committee of Beijing Daxing International Airport Economic Zone. The centre was jointly set up by the committee, the embassies of a number of African nations in China and Chinese companies including Asia-Africa Silk Road International Business Co.

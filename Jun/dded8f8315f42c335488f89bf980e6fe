The Herald Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE’S athletes found the going tough on the first day of the Africa Senior Championships that got underway yesterday with most of them failing to go beyond the heats in 100m and 400m events at the Cote d’Or National Sports Complex in Mauritius. Zimbabwe had a number of athletes competing yesterday. In the men’s 100m, only Ngoni Makusha was able to advance to the semi-finals when he came fourth in 10.31seconds in heat seven of the eight heats lined up in the morning. However, he failed to make it for the final after finishing fifth with a time of 10.29seconds in heat one of the three semi-final heats. The top two from each heat and the best two across the heats progressed to the final. The rest of the athletes bowed out in the opening round. Dickson Kamungeremu posted a time of 10.48 seconds in heat four to finish third but his time was not good enough to see him through to the semis. It was the same story for Panashe Nhenga, who came seventh in 10.79seconds. In the women’s 100m event, Michelle Zuze was fourth in 12.10seconds and she missed out on the semi-finals. Garren Muwishi and Artwell Simon were up for the men’s 400m event. Muwishi did not finish the race due to an injury and Simon came fifth in 48.36seconds. The championships are running until Sunday. Zimbabwe are up for the 4x100m men’s relay today.

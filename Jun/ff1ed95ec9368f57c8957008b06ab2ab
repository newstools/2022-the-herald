The Herald ZIMBABWE endured another horror show in the third and last Twenty20 International against Afghanistan at Harare Sports Club yesterday as they lost by 25 runs. The Chevrons have now suffered a whitewash. After the bowlers had done a fine job to restrict their opponents to 125 for eight wickets, they crumbled to hand the tourists a clean sweep of all six matches played between the sides. The home side made one change, giving Clive Madande a début as wicketkeeper in place of Regis Chakabva. Afghanistan again won the toss and decided to bat on a mild, largely sunny day. The Chevrons should have fancied their chances after restricting the visitors to 125-8. Wessly Madhevere and Roy Kaia opened the batting, making 25 together. Madhevere, having hit two fours, skied a catch to midwicket for 14 off 14 balls, off a well-flighted ball from Ashraf. Tadiwanashe Marumani joined Kaia, and the batters struggled against a tight over from Rashid Khan, brought into the attack early in this situation. Marumani called for a quick single and Kaia was run out for 12 – 40 for two in the seventh over. Ervine was out lbw to a superb googly from Noor Ahmad for one, and at 42 for three, after seven overs, the alarm bells were ringing. Then came a potential disaster as Raza moved down the pitch to attack his second ball from Ashraf and was stumped. At 44 for four in the eighth over Zimbabwe had lost their advantage and were now in danger of throwing the match away.

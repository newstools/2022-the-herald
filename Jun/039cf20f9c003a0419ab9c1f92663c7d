The Herald Court Reporter 
New York Times Zimbabwean correspondent,  Jeffrey Moyo has been fined $200 000 after he was found guilty of violating sections of the Immigration Act after he manufactured fake press cards for two journalists from the same publication to operate in the country sometime last year. Bulawayo magistrate Mr Mark Nzira had also sentenced Moyo to two years in prison but wholly suspended the jail term on condition that he does not commit a similar offence within the next five years. Moyo assisted Christina Goldbaum and João Silva to acquire fake press cards from the Zimbabwe Media Commission, which they used to get Visas at Bulawayo Airport. The Visas were cancelled three days later after an immigration officer unearthed the scam that saw the two foreign journalists deported. Moyo was convicted after full trial.

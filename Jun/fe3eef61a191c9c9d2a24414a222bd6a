The Herald FULL sisters, Lily Blue and Obscure, will race against each other, for the first time, in the 1 800m OK Grand Challenge (Gr1) at Borrowdale Park on Saturday afternoon. Five-year-old Lily Blue and four-year-old Obscure are sired by Black Minnaloushe (US) and are out of Mammy Blue (ZIM), a Kitalpha (US) mare. Both were bred by Geoff Armitage and on Saturday they will race in the Gin’ll Fix It Syndicate’s silks (pink, pink sleeves. turquoise armbands and cap). Obscure wears the late Betty Prosser’s colours — Betty had a share in Obscure prior to her passing. The illustrious Lily Blue needs no introduction. She has won 12 races (including Classics) with only occasional blips and carries 59.5 kg in the OK Grand Challenge. On the other hand, Obscure has won five races, including her last start, and perhaps may only now be coming to hand. To date, 2000m and further has seemed her game but she will carry 52 kgs on Saturday and could surprise.

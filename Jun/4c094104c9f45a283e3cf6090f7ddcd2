The Herald Sports Reporter HOSTS Zimbabwe surrendered the One Day International series to Afghanistan after losing the second match at Harare Sports Club by eight wickets. Afghanistan now lead the three-match series 2-0, ahead of the dead rubber on Thursday. The Chevrons laboured to 228 all out after they were put in to bat first. Innocent Kaia scored his maiden ODI half century in his second match for Zimbabwe after hitting 63. Ryan Burl scored 51 runs late on to help the faltering Zimbabwe batting cross the 200-run mark. Skipper Craig Ervine said their score was below par, as Afghanistan coasted to victory when they reached 229/2 with 33 balls remaining. “We know that the conditions become better in the afternoon session. We got starts but couldn’t kick on. We knew that 260-270 was going to be par. We knew that facing the new ball would be a challenge. A match can change in five overs; we have shown that today,” said Ervine. Afghanistan’s Ibrahim Zadran scored his first ODI century and shared the highest second-wicket stand against Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe, of 195 runs with Rahmat Shah, to ensure a successful chase of 229 and a series win for Afghanistan, with a game in hand. This victory took Afghanistan to 90 points from 11 matches on the World Cup Super League table and, if they sweep the series 3-nil on Thursday, will put them in second place on the points’ table and in a good position to secure automatic qualification for the 2023 World Cup. Zimbabwe, on the other end of the table, remain in 12th place with only three wins from 14 matches.

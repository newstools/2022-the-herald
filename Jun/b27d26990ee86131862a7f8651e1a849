The Herald Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE’S Under-19 team emerged gold medallists at the just-ended Confederation of Southern Africa Netball Associations (COSANA) Tri-Nations Cup in Blantyre, Malawi. The tournament featured Namibia, Zimbabwe and Malawi. The three countries fielded both their senior and Under-19 teams. For Zimbabwe, it was the Under-19s who had the best performance managing to win three of their four matches. They completed a double over Namibia and beat Malawi in their first meeting. They then lost 36-37 to Malawi in their last encounter on Thursday. But their performance in the other three matches was good enough to earn them the top spot at the tournament. The Under-19s are preparing for the African Union Sports Council (AUSC) Region Five Under-20 Youth Games to be staged in Malawi, in December. The just ended tournament gave the technical team a chance to assess the team’s progress in a competition set-up.

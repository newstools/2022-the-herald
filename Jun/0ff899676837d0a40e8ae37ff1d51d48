The Herald JOHANNESBURG. – President Cyril Ramaphosa says young people being left out of the job market with no access to training opportunities remains the government’s biggest concern as the country commemorated Youth Day. The country’s high youth unemployment rate was a talking point for Mr Ramaphosa and opposition political parties at Youth Day events yesterday. Mr Ramaphosa said the most significant challenge facing young people was a lack of jobs and no access to skills. While Ramaphosa said the government needed to support young people, opposition political parties such as the EFF and the DA blamed the president and the ANC for the bleak unemployment figures. Mr Ramaphosa took his Youth Day address to Mthatha in the Eastern Cape. He also participated in a “Fourth Industrial Revolution Expo” at St John’s College. – News24.com

The Herald Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE limited overs captain Craig Ervine’s poor form in the recent T20I cricket series against Afghanistan has come with some repercussions after the middle order batsman lost six players on the ICC Men’s T20I Batting Rankings. The left hander slid to number 97 in the latest rankings, reviewed on Tuesday, following Zimbabwe’s series whitewash to Afghanistan. Ervine, who was confirmed as the limited overs captain in March this year, was the biggest loser in the rankings after managing only 12 runs in three innings. He scored 9, 2 and 1 in the three matches. Wessly Madhevere, the only other Zimbabwean player among the top 100 T20I batsmen, fell one place to 40th place. But Ervine lost a massive 34 places since attaining his career best 63rd ranking last month. He reached his highest T20I ranking after he had scored his fifth T20I half ton, to help Zimbabwe win the first match of that five-match T20I series. However, the Chevrons went on to slump to a shock 2-3 series defeat to Namibia before the latest 0-3 thumping by Afghanistan

The Herald JOHANNESBURG — Former Kaizer Chiefs striker Katlego Mphela has backed Zimbabwean striker Khama Billiat for a leadership role at the South African Premiership football club, believing the responsibility could inspire the Amakhosi star to perform at a higher level. Billiat is no stranger to wearing the captain’s armband, having done so at international level for Zimbabwe whenever he was called upon to do so. <img class="size-full wp-image-578367" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/asa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/asa.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/asa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Khama Billiat Mphela feels Billiat is an option for Zwane, while the likes of Itumeleng Khune, Mulomowandau Mathoho and Keagan Dolly are also available to take on the huge responsibility of wearing the armband. Khune, however, is not guaranteed regular game time, with Brandon Petersen and Bruce Bvuma expected to battle it out for the number one jersey ahead of the veteran shot-stopper.  “I think Khune, Mathoho, Dolly. I can not put pressure on the new players as they still need to settle and establish themselves in the team. Unless if they manage to sign a player like (Bongani) Zungu, then you can throw him into the deep end because he has been there,” Mphela told the Siya crew. “Billat as well maybe that’s what he also needs to start performing as he previously did at Sundowns and his captained Zimbabwe before.” — Laduma.

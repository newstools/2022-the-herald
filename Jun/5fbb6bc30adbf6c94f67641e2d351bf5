The Herald Sports Reporter Giants Highlanders have been found guilty and fined by the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League Disciplinary Committee for the violence that rocked their match against FC Platinum. Bosso were slapped with a US$6 000 fine and the match, which was abandoned with six minutes remaining following crowd trouble at Mandava, was awarded to FC Platinum on a 3-0 scoreline. Bosso confirmed the PSL ruling in a statement yesterday. “Highlanders FC has been found guilty by the Zimbabwe Castle Lager Premier Soccer League for missile throwing in a match played against FC Platinum at Mandava Stadium on the 23rd of April 2022. “The club was fined US$6 000 and FC Platinum was awarded three points and three goals. The match was abandoned after 84 minutes of game time with a score of 1-1,” said the statement. The match was called off after Highlanders supporters stormed the pitch in protest against a penalty awarded to FC Platinum. While Bosso continue to languish in the bottom half of the table, FC Platinum are now second on the log standings with 34 points, one behind leaders Chicken Inn, at the halfway stage of the campaign. The platinum miners went to the mid-season break on a high after winning their last four games in succession.

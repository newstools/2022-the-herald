The Herald PARIS. – French voters cast their ballot in the first round of parliamentary elections as President Emmanuel Macron seeks to secure a majority amid a resurgent left-wing coalition. Polling stations opened at 8am yesterday after voters in overseas territories cast ballots earlier in the weekend. About 48 million citizens are eligible to vote. Government insiders expect a relatively poor showing in yesterday’s first round for Macron’s coalition “Ensemble”, with record numbers of voters seen abstaining. Voter turnout in mainland France — excluding overseas territories — at 15:00 GMT came at 39.4 percent, the lowest seen in at least 20 years for a first round of parliamentary elections, according to interior ministry data. It was only 40.8 percent in the last election at this stage, however. Ivan Warren, who voted for Macron in the presidential election, wants to see him win a majority. “It’s important to me that we have a strong government, which allows us to represent France in the most effective way possible,” the 56-year-old computer scientist said. Elections for the 577 seats in the lower house National Assembly are a two-round process. More than 6 000 candidates, ranging in age from 18 to 92, are running to win seats in the National Assembly in the first round of the election. Those who receive the most votes will advance to the decisive second round on June 19. Following Macron’s re-election in May, his centrist coalition is seeking an absolute majority that would enable it to implement his campaign promises, which include tax cuts and raising the retirement age from 62 to 65. The latest opinion polls suggest Macron and his allies may have trouble winning more than half of the parliamentary seats. A government with a large but not absolute majority would still be able to rule, but only by bargaining with legislators. — Al Jazeera.

The Herald JOHANNESBURG. – The World Health Organisation (WHO) is rallying its partners to come up with a plan that won’t leave Africa behind in the fight against monkeypox. “We must avoid having two different responses to monkeypox – one for western countries which are only now experiencing significant transmission and another for Africa,” said the WHO’s Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti. Twenty-three non-endemic countries in Europe, America and Africa have reported 257 cases to the WHO. Seven African countries reported nearly 1 400 monkeypox cases so far this year –  1 392 suspected and 44 confirmed cases – in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, and Sierra Leone. There has been a noticeable spread in Nigeria. “For example, until 2019, monkeypox in Nigeria was reported mainly in the south of the country but since 2020, the virus has moved into central, eastern, and northern parts of the country,” the WHO said in a statement. The first monkeypox case recorded outside Africa was detected in the United Kingdom in a person who had a travel history to Nigeria in early May. At the time, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) revealed that 15 cases had been recorded since January, but said it did not constitute an outbreak. In countries such as Nigeria and the DRC, monkeypox can be traced back to 1970 when the first human cases were detected. Through the years, the disease has been a recurring motif. The WHO said lessons on dealing with it should be drawn from there. The WHO called on global leaders not to leave Africa behind. “It is critical that the continent has equal access to effective monkeypox vaccines and that globally, we ensure vaccine doses reach every community in need,” Dr Moeti added. – News24.com

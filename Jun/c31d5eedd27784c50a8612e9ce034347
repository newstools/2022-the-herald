The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter RUNYARARO Primary School from Ruwa were crowned the Winter Chess Festival champions after they won five medals at Windview Primary School on Saturday. The school was outstanding in the tournament that had over 200 junior chess players who took part in the festival. The festival has been running for the past six years and this year they had an increase in numbers with schools from as far as Chivhu taking part. Tournament director Prince Nechavana said the event went on well and they are grateful to the Zimbabwe Chess Federation who gave them a chance to compete. “Despite the bad weather being experienced in the country, junior chess players had to brave the weather with some coming from as far as Chivhu. “Hartman House was represented by over 40 junior chess players. The results of the festival were very close as we could not finish the last round due to the software crush. However, chief arbiter and his team did well to ensure that chess wins as results for the four rounds played showed that most of the schools had an average of a medal each. “The floating shield remained at Windview Primary School and will be up for grabs in 2023 when the school hosts its seventh edition. “I would like to thank the Zimbabwe Chess Federation (ZCF) for supporting the festival. The chess equipment used at the tournament came from ZCF. We also want to thank the school heads, sports directors of various schools and their parents for promoting the game of Chess. We also appreciate the support of Windview Primary School administrator Martin Dondo, and the entire staff and parents for supporting chess by ensuring that chess is taught at schools,” said Nechavana.

The Herald LONDON. — Sadio Mane has agreed personal terms on a three-year contract with German Bundesliga football champions Bayern Munich ahead of a proposed move from Liverpool, according to reports. The German champions have had two bids rejected for the Senegalese forward. But football journalist Fabrizio Romano has claimed on Twitter Liverpool are aware of his desire to leave for Bayern and the transfer has entered the “final stages’’ and is now “really close’’. Like fellow forward Mohamed Salah, Mane has just a year left on his contract at Anfield, putting pressure on Liverpool to sell him this summer to avoid losing him for nothing next year. Bayern are hoping to sign him for a cut-price fee, but Jurgen Klopp’s side are determined not to sell for less than they deem his value, and have placed a £42m price-tag on his head. And German outlet Bild report Bayern are aiming to make it third time lucky with a £34.6m bid. Despite still falling £7.4m short of the Reds’ valuation, Bayern hope that their latest package will tempt Liverpool to sell. The deal would see that Bavarian outfit pay £30.3m up front with £4.3m in add-ons. Reds boss Jurgen Klopp will not stand in the way of Mane’s departure should both clubs agree a price. After signing midfielder Ryan Gravenberch from Ajax on Monday, Bayern sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic has focused his attentions on bringing Mane to the Allianz Arena. Having received the Bayern board’s approval to make another bid for Mane, he is hoping to conclude a deal with Liverpool quickly. Bild expand on this by detailing that Mane’s agent Bjorn Bezemer met with Salihamidzic in early May to discuss a move. Liverpool and Bayern have good relations, which was strengthened when the former signed Thiago Alcantara from the latter for £25m in September 2020. — Mailonline

The Herald BARCELONA. – Colombian singer Shakira and Barcelona soccer star Gerard Pique have split, both have confirmed. The pair, whose relationship began in 2010, have two sons together, Milan and Sasha. A brief statement released by the singer’s communication agency, confirmed: “We regret to confirm that we are parting ways. For the well-being of our children, who are our highest priority, we ask that you respect their privacy. Thank you for your understanding.” It comes after the Barcelona defender, who won the World Cup with Spain in 2010, was allegedly caught in bed with another woman. It has been reported that the couple have been living separately for a few weeks after Pique was kicked out of their family home. According to Spanish outlet El Periodico, he has been staying in a bachelor pad and has been living a “party lifestyle” since the split. Further reports claim the Spain international has been frequenting nightclubs with team-mate Riqui Puig and his group of friends, often returning home as late as two or three in the morning. Claims that the woman with whom he had allegedly cheated was the mother of Barcelona teammate Gavi are false. Shakira hinted at disharmony between the pair in her latest hit “Te Felicito” with Rauw Alejandro, with the 45-year-old singing: “To complete you I broke into pieces; I was warned, but I didn’t listen; I realised that yours is false; it was the drop that overflowed the glass; Don’t tell me you’re sorry, that sounds sincere, but I know you well and I know you’re lying.” Pique’s football career at Barcelona has recently been in question due to a succession of injury issues – although he still managed to make 39 appearances for the Blaugrana in 2021-22. However, according to reports in Spain he has no intention of hanging up his boots yet and still has two years left on his deal at Camp Nou. The 35-year-old has been tipped as a future club president. – Mirror.

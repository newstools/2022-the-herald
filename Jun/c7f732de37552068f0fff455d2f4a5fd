The Herald Herald Reporter The examination fees for the November Zimsec public examinations have been set and candidates have to be registered and the fees paid between July 22 and July 29. According to a statement from the Zimbabwe Schools Examination Council yesterday, candidate registration and all fee payments, which must be made in Zimbabwe dollars, must be made through the examination centres. Zimsec will not accept payment from candidates directly into its accounts and stressed that there will be no late registrations. Parents have to heed the registration period and any deadlines set by the centres, Zimsec said. The fees have been set in US dollars, but the actual payment must be made only in Zimbabwe dollars using the interbank rate of 22 July. The Government will be subsidising the fees for candidates from Government schools, local authority schools and not-for-profit mission schools, paying 55 percent of the set fees. Candidates from private schools, colleges or sitting as private candidates will have to pay the full fees. The full fees are Grade 6 US$11, Grade 7 US$22, ‘O’ Level US$24 a subject and ‘A’ Level US$48 a subject. But parents will pay equivalent of US$5 for Grade Six, the equivalent of US$10 for Grade 7, the equivalent US$11 a subject for  ‘O’ Level and the equivalent US$22 a subject for ‘A’ Level following the Government subsidy.

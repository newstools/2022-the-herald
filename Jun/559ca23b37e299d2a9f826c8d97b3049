The Herald Herald Reporter SUSPECTED CCC activists have torched the homes of Zanu PF officials, smashing shop windows and stoning cars in Seke ostensibly to avenge the death of Moreblessing Ali whose remains were found in a well in the suburb of Nyatsime. According to witnesses, a house of Zanu PF branch chairman Cde George Murambatsvina was burnt down while a Gazebo at Chibanguza Shopping centre in the new suburb that is on the outskirts of Chitungwiza, was also reduced to rubbles. Cars were not spared as the suspected opposition supporters ran amok sealing off roads and shutting down businesses. This comes as the CCC vice-chairperson Mr Job Sikhala has openly instigated the party supporters to take the war to Zanu PF in the wake of the unfortunate murder of Ali, in a case that police are currently investigating and which witnesses and friends have said was a pure case of gender-based violence. The violence that erupted in Nyatsime also comes as the opposition, civic society and some Western embassies have been trying to score cheap political goals through baseless claims that a Zanu PF activist is behind the murder of Ali. Mr Sikhala is on record vowing to avenge the death of Ali. “This death of Moreblessing Ali, let me tell them and the whole Zimbabwe, the whole family shall perish whichever way we are going to do it the family will suffer, you might not hear about this family again, it will be wiped from the face of the earth if they are not going to apologise as soon. Many people have volunteered to do the business to make sure the spirit of Moreblessing Ali will not rest until we avenge, and truly the avenging will be done,” said Sikhala. And true to the threats by Sikhala, Nyatsime was this afternoon a war zone as marauding CCC activists, went on an orgy of violence targeting homes of Zanu PF members after incitement from Sikhala.

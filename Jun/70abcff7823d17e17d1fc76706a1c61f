The Herald Tadious Manyepo in BULAWAYO WARRIORS midfielder Marvelous Nakamba and Southampton legend Dexter Blackstock believe the future of Zimbabwean football is bright if junior teams get the much-needed support. The two were speaking on the sidelines of the two-day inaugural Marvelous Nakamba Foundation Under-17 tournament that ended at White City Stadium yesterday. Manicaland Juniors Academy (MAJESA) emerged the winners after beating Highlanders 2-1 in the final. The Eddie Shumba-coached side got their goals through double-scorer Norest Mazema while Nhlanhla Musaliwa got Bosso’s consolation. The well-organised eight-team competition saw Dynamos being disqualified after fielding an over-aged player. The Glamour Boys, under the tutelage of seasoned junior football coach Lloyd “Mablanyo” Chigowe, were in Group A together with Highlanders and MAJESA as well as Njube Sundowns. They won all their group matches against Bosso (1-0), MAJESA (3-0) and Njube Sundowns (3-1) before it was detected through documentary evidence that they had fielded an ineligible player. That meant Highlanders, who were the runners-up, and MAJESA, who were third, progressed to the semi-finals. Bosso beat Chicken Inn 1-0 in the first semi-final encounter while MAJESA walloped Ajax 5-0 in the other encounter to set-up a potentially thrilling final. The tie was a cracker, with budding talent on show much to the excitement of Nakamba and Blackstock. Nakamba, who plies his trade with Aston Villa in the English Premier League, said the youngsters should get constant composure to fully develop. “We are trying to fill this gap. There is enormous talent in this country which needs to be nurtured. I am thrilled with what I have just witnessed. The talent is just too much, we can do well as a country if we join hands and support the youngsters from the grassroots,” said Nakamba. “I am happy the tournament has finally been held after the Covid-19 disturbances the last time out. “I am really impressed with the talent that was on display in the two days the tournament was played. We hope that the next edition will be bigger and better. “The junior players really need our support. Our future is very bright from what I have seen and imagine this is a tournament that only had eight teams from across the country. Imagine the other teams who were not here. We have the talent and we just need to nurture that, continuously.” Nakamba is a close friend to Blackstock, who played for Portsmouth and Southampton in the English Premier League before hanging his boots about eight years ago. <img class="size-full wp-image-625622" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/Dexter-Blackstock.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/Dexter-Blackstock.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/Dexter-Blackstock-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dexter Blackstock He is now the MAJESA UK Ambassador and also their chief scout given his contacts across Europe. Blackstock was blown away with the talent on show at the contest and revealed he will be closely monitoring at least four players he identified at the tournament. Already MAJESA captain Prosper Padera, who was arguably the best player on show at the meet, is being prepared for Europe. “The talent I have witnessed is massive. I am used to watch MAJESA but I tell you, I was very impressed. These boys have the right potential,” said Blackstock. “I am really happy to be here and I am happy MAJESA won.”

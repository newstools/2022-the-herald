The Herald LILONGWE. – Malawi’s President, Lazarus Chakwera,  yesterday announced that Vice President Saulos Chilima would be stripped of all delegated duties for allegedly receiving money from businessman Zuneth Sattar. The president has also fired Malawi Police Inspector General George Kainja, as well as his chief of staff, Prince Kapondamgaga. Mr Chakwera  said a total of 53 current and former public officers received money from Sattar between March 2021 and October 2021. There are also 31 individuals from the private sector, media and civil society who allegedly received money from Sattar. Mr Chakwera said the officers include those from Office of the President and Cabinet, Malawi Police Service, Office of the Vice President, State House, Reserve Bank of Malawi, ACB, Malawi Broadcasting Station and various ministries. Apart from Chilima, there was no other member of his cabinet who had been mentioned on the list. The bureau has found that among the 84 individuals accused of receiving money from Sattar, there are 13 who have been extensively investigated such that the bureau has concluded that they conducted themselves corruptly. Mr Chakwera noted that the constitution did not provide for the suspension of the vice president or his removal of office by the president. “The best I can do, and what I have done, is to withhold from his office any delegated duties while waiting for the bureau to substantiate its allegations against him and to make known its course of action.” – Malawi24.com

The Herald Ellina Mhlanga Senior Sports Reporter PROMISING swimmer Donata Katai yesterday set a new personal best time in the 50m backstroke at the ongoing 19th FINA World Championships in Budapest, Hungary. Katai finished ninth in Heat Three in 29.81seconds. Overall, she was placed number 25 out of 39 swimmers from the four heats. The top 16 progressed to the semi-final. Despite missing on the semi-final, Katai managed to take off some time from her previous time of 30.17seconds. Coach, Masi Takaedza, said setting a new personal best time was pleasing and believes there is room for improvement from the teenage swimmer. “We are happy with this performance. It’s a PB you can’t ask for more. “Going forward it’s about training hard and continue working hard. It’s about managing the programme. Goal setting for the next competition as well,” said Takaedza. The Heat was won by Katharine Berkoff from the United States in 27.49seconds. She was followed home by Regan Smith with a time of 27.70seconds. Italy’s Silvia Scalia was third in 27.86seconds and Simona Kubova of Czech Republic was fourth in 28.37seconds to complete the top four that qualified for the semi-final from Heat Three. Zimbabwe still have two more swimmers — Nomvula Mjimba and Liam Davis — who are expected to compete today. Takaedza said they just need to stay focused ahead of their events today. “We hope tomorrow (today) Liam and Nomvula will get PBs. We have been training every day in preparation. We will see how it goes. They need to stay focused and go for it,” said Takaedza. Mjimba is up for the women’s 100m freestyle and Davis is taking part in the men’s 200m breaststroke. Mjimba is also scheduled to swim the 50m freestyle event on Friday. Zimbabwe have four swimmers at the championships. Unfortunately, Denilson Cyprianos had to pull out of competition because of an injury.

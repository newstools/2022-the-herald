The Herald LONDON. — Barcelona will reportedly make a final offer of €40 million (£34.5m) in a desperate bid to land top target Robert Lewandowski. The Spanish football giants have made no secret of their desire to add the 33-year-old, who is in the final year of his contract at Bayern Munich, to their attack this summer. Bayern, who recently added Sadio Mane from Liverpool, have so far stood firm but Barcelona are, according to Spanish outlet Sport, ready to make their best — and final — offer to land Lewandowski. Sport detail that Barcelona will commit to £34.5m plus add-ons. It is said they are not willing to go above that price point given Lewandowski is in the final 12 months of his Bayern contract and is aged 33. Lewandowski boldly went public earlier this summer stating that he sees no future for himself at Bayern Munich. That was expected to speed up his departure but heading into late June he remains frustrated in Bavaria. Sport’s report continued to say that Barcelona president Joan Laporta has not lost hope in sealing a deal and made a call to Lewandowski and his agent, Pini Zahavi, last week, calling for patience. In that call it is reported that Lewandowski was told he remains their top target and delays are down to the club’s perilous financial situation, which requires player sales to allow room on the salary cap to register new players. Lewandowski reportedly made a request to Laporta that a deal is wrapped up before July 12, which is when pre-season begins for Bayern. — Mailonline

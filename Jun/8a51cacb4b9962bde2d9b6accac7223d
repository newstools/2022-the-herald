The Herald Business Reporter Seed Co senior manager public relations and special programmes Marjorie Mutemererwa won the Best Resilient Communicator award at the recently held Women in Public Relations and Communications of Zimbabwe awards ceremony, for her sterling work in the industry. Ms Mutemererwa was recognised along with 38 other most inspirational women in public relations and communications in the country. Commenting on her the award, which is one of her many accolades, Ms Mutemererwa said she was humbled to receive the recognition as a resilient communicator in a challenging environment. She added she was also glad the profession was growing in leaps and bounds with various stakeholders realising its importance in brand management or crisis management. “I am very humbled by this recognition. For me being resilient means being constant in the way you communicate. Communication is not just about opening your mouth but being effective with the right information to all stakeholders be it the media, banks, Government and in my case farmers. It is the ability to unbundle a message so that everyone can understand it,” she said. She added as the profession continues to gain traction as critical in organisations, it was also imperative to groom young communicators to be effective. “I stand on the shoulders of those who have been before me and I strongly believe it is also important to groom and mentor others who are coming into the profession so that they take the button and carry on with the work,” she said. Ms Mutemererwa holds a Masters in Leadership and Management, a Bachelor of English and Communication and several post graduate diplomas in Public Relations and Communication. She sits on various industry and not for profits boards.

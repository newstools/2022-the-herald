The programme constituted topics on unit trusts and trading on the ZSE, and that sparked Kudzai’s interest to start investing on the stock market. Kudzai began investing on the stock market through asset managers in 2005. He began to follow financial literacy advocates and  during the lockdown period, the podcasts on investing on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange helped him in his investment journey. The Investment Strategy Kudzai is a long term investor and the main strategy he uses when investing on the ZSE is to set a monthly  investment target and set aside a certain amount of money which he uses to buy shares. He follows the news through reading newspapers and listening to business shows on the radio that helps him to map his ways of investing on the ZSE. Kudzai also checks on the market statistics and prices of the counters after each trading session.

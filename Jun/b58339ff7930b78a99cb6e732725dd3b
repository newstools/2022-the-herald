The Herald Bridget Mavhimira-Arts Correspondent Organisers of the Miss University of Zimbabwe (Miss UZ) 2022 pageant have said preparations are at an advanced stage, with the finalists confirming their participation. The event, which will have three categories – introduction, evening wear and casual wear – will be held this Saturday at the institution’s Great Hall. After making it in the preliminary competition where 32 girls had to showcase their catwalk and speaking abilities, 18 girls were selected to appear on the final night which is being hosted by the UZ Rotaract team. Running under the theme; “Impact to change” which according to Ayanda Candice Sibanda, the reigning Miss UZ and creative director of the event, describes what they are looking for in the next Miss University of Zimbabwe. “Basically, we are looking for someone who is willing to impact change in their society in order to inspire others to do the same,” she said. Contesting for the title of Miss UZ are Precious Chakwiza, Isheanesu Mahachi, Nomaqhwae Mabhena, Allyfinae Mwanyali, Michel Tshuma, Nobukhosi Sibanda, Kudzai Mitchel Matizha, Wakatendeka Mhlanga, Praise Chikotosa, Nyasha Amanda Chihambiro, Farai Katiyo, Trizer Khan, Vanessa Chinhengo, Tanatswa Vera, Getrude Shasha, Alice Ruvarashe Katenjele, Grace Mashavike and Lerato Laura Nare. More girls showed up this year which is evident that the pageant is growing, said Wisdom Muzondiwa, the Rotaract vice president. “There is so much growth this year as more girls are willing to take a stand and be champions of change in different spheres that they come from, which is why people will get to see 18 girls appearing on the stage rather than the usual 15 or 10”, he said. “Miss University of Zimbabwe is more than a beauty pageant, it is a competition meant to choose an ambassador of the institution because the queen has a responsibility to voice out social issues that deeply affect students by working hand-in-hand with other leaders such as the Student Representative Council and other presidents of different clubs in order to fulfil a common goal,” said Sibanda.

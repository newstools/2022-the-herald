The Herald Sports Reporter BRAD Evans was in top form with the ball yesterday as Zimbabwe A rallied to beat hosts Nepal by three wickets in the opening match of the unofficial one-day series at the Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground in the ancient city of Kirtipur yesterday. Evans was named Player of the Match for his four-wicket haul. His bowling figures of 4-27 were instrumental in the destruction of the hosts who were bowled out for 137 runs in just 31.3 overs. There were also two wickets each for Victor Nyauchi, Cephas Zhuwao and leg-spinning all-rounder Brandon Mavuta. Zimbabwe A won the toss and elected to field first. They had the hosts in all sorts of trouble at 84/7 by the time they started the 19th over. Sompal Kami was the highest scorer for Nepal with 30 runs.
Zimbabwe’s chase took a bumpy turn after losing opening batsman Zhuwao for 32 runs from 29 deliveries. The left hander was involved in a-39 run partnership for the opening wicket with Innocent Kaia, who finished unbeaten with a run a ball 48, as Zimbabwe A battled their way to 137/7 in 26 overs. The rest of the batters could not make meaningful contributions. But Evans returned with the bat to score two maximums for his unbeaten 17 runs from 19 balls and ensure the visitors crossed the line after encountering some nervous moments during the innings. Zimbabwe A now lead the three-match series 1-0. Meanwhile, at Harare Sports Club today, the Zimbabwe XI cricket team need to avoid defeat to keep the five-match T20 series against visiting South Africa A alive. The tourists hold the advantage after cruising to back-to-back wins in the first two matches. The Zimbabweans are using the series as part of the build-up to the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Qualifier, which they are expected to host in July.

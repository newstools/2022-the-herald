The Herald LONDON. — Jurgen Klopp insists Liverpool are taking nothing for granted ahead of tonight’s decisive Champions League football semi-final second leg at Villarreal. The match kicks-off at 9pm. The final obstacle in Liverpool’s quest to reach a third Champions League final in five seasons sees them head to Spain with a 2-0 advantage after last week’s comprehensive first-leg victory at Anfield. Despite holding a commanding advantage, Klopp is under no illusions there is still a job to be done and is relishing the challenge that only Champions League semi-finals produce. “We know that it is half-time,” Klopp told his pre-match press conference. “In the best possible way we have to ignore the result from the first leg. If it were a cup game where only one game decided, and we had to go to Villarreal, we would try to win there. “We know they will give all they have, that is absolutely clear. With all the things Unai said after the game… it’s going to be a tough one but that is completely fine. Champions League semi-finals should be tough; we never expect them to be easy and this will not be easy. But we played a good game at home and we better play a good game there as well.” Klopp continued: “At this moment, a Champions League semi-final is the most important game you can play. Whatever happened in the last few weeks or will happen in the next few weeks is not important, for this moment is clear. “You never know if you will reach a semi-final again or if we will ever have the chance again to go to the final, you never know. We have an exceptional team here and nothing is for granted. You need luck in moments and all these sorts of things, so you better treat it carefully and be ready, and we will be ready.’’ — Sky Sports/AP

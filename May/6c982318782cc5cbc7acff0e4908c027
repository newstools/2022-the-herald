The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter SOUTH African Luca Filipi took over the leader-board at the FBC Zimbabwe Open Golf Championship when he carded an impressive 11-under after the two qualifying rounds yesterday. Filipi started the day on four-under. He was in his best form at Chapman Golf Club where he played his second round and carded seven-under-par 65 yesterday, to make an overall 11-under. The Milnerton Golf Club player, who turned professional in 2020, is ahead of seasoned campaigner Loius de Jaguar, who is on six-under and trails by five shots. De Jager followed up his opening round three-under-par with another three-under yesterday. Zambian Madalitso Muthiya is tied on five-under with day one leader Louis Albetse, Jaco Ahlers, Albert Venter and Dan Erickson of the United States. Wynard Dingle and Nikhil Rama are tied on position eight as Ryan Cairns comes in at number 10, as Zimbabwe’s best-placed golfer. Cairns who opened up on one under-par at Royal Harare managed to improve at Chapman where he carded a two-under-par 70 and was tied with Hennie O’Kennedy, Neil Schietekat and Keagan Thomas. A total of 14 Zimbabweans managed to make the cut and they include amateurs Kegan Shutt and Michael Wallace who are both national team players. Shutt and Wallace are making an impact on their first appearance at the Zimbabwe Open and this will give them confidence going forward.

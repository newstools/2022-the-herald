The Herald Conrad Mupesa Mashonaland West Bureau TAWANDA Mhako is this year’s Zimbabwe Open Under-16  Development Section 2022 chess tournament overall winner. The budding teenager beat other 63 participants during the annual biggest national tournament held in Harare at the weekend which was sponsored by Minerva Risk Advisors, Crystal Candy and New World Properties. Said the youngster: “It was quite a difficult tournament from the very beginning. Each and every game was just as important. There were some very tough players amongst us. I felt pressure from the 5th and 6th round as majority of players were just one point behind me and losing either of the games would have led to an upset to my results. “At the end of the day, I managed to maintain a perfect score of 6/6. Cheers to everyone who participated.” He won a trophy, a chess set, gold medal, certificate, chess tie and stationery pack. Mhako also made headlines last year after he drew South African’s television presenter and model Kimberly Robison, who went to surprise him with a visit. The multi-talented teenager, tagged Robinson on Twitter.  He has drawn the attention of various influencers, including President Mnangagwa,  Mashonaland West Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Mary Mliswa-Chikoka, and socialite and prophet, Passion Java.

The Herald Grace Chingoma Senior Sports Reporter CHAMPIONS Platinum Queens beat Harare City 52– 32 in the Premier Netball League’s top-of-the-table clash at the Stodart Netball Complex over the weekend. The weekend’s games were the third bubble since the league action started in April. The league is running its second season and just like last year, the matches are being played in a bubble set-up. And the Zvishavane side won all the three games they played. They gave BTTC a netball lesson, thrashing them 110-5. They hammered ZUPCO 98–10. Harare City also hammered ZUPCO 72–18 and beat BTTC 54-13. Harare City coach Ropafadzo Mutsauki, who is also the senior national team’s coach, has since said that they are on a rebuilding exercise and hopes that by the time they get into the third year, they will have a strong team.

The Herald Prosper Dembedza Court Correspondent A 20-year-old Zambian ritualist yesterday appeared in court on allegations of defrauding an unsuspecting man of US$74 000 after misrepresenting to him that it was payment to facilitate US$20 million which he had received on his behalf from his ancestors. Daniel Epic Kato was facing fraud charges when he appeared before Harare magistrate Mrs Yeukai Dzuda, who remanded him in custody. The court heard that on March 2, Kato and two others only identified as Mugabi and Kimbungwe, hatched a plan to defraud the complainant and disguised as ritualists. They called the complainant, Mr Graham Mutero, and told him that his ancestors wanted to bless him with US$20 million. Kato, Mugabi and Kimbungwe showed the complainant money which was stashed in a bag which they said was the US$20 million his ancestors wanted them to give to him. According to Mutero’s statement, the trio went on to ask him to randomly pick US$300 from the bag and advised him to go and spend it as proof that it was indeed genuine money. Mutero took US$300 from the bag which he spent without any hustles, which boosted his confidence in the trio. It is the State’s contention that the trio convinced Mutero to raise US$74 000 so that a ritual could be conducted for him to access the US$20 million. Mutero allegedly sold his property to raise the required money and brought it to the trio. The trio allegedly handed over the bag to Mutero, but as he was about to leave, one of them said they should pray before he left. During the prayer session, one of the accused persons changed the bags and gave Mutero one full of newspapers. The matter came to light when Mutero opened the bag upon arrival at his house when he discovered that it had newspapers. A report was made to the police, leading to Kato’s arrest. Mugabi and Kimbungwe are still at large.

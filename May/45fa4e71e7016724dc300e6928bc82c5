The Herald Walter Nyamukondiwa Kariba Bureau Show promoter and former Jah Prayzah keyboardist Biggie Katura has been arrested over an unpaid US$380 hotel bill related to hosting Andy Muridzo. Katura hosted the afro-fusion musician in Kariba from 24 to 26 September, 2021, but failed to settle the hotel bill for five rooms until he was arrested at another gig involving Freeman at the weekend. He has since appeared before Kariba resident magistrate Mr Tapiwa Banda, who remanded him in custody to tomorrow for sentence after pleading guilty for making off without paying since September 2021. Prosecutor Miss Carren Musiiwa appeared for the State. Katura allegedly secured five rooms at Dzimbahwe Lodge for two nights, but disappeared without paying after several unfulfilled promises to settle the US$380 bill. A report was made on December 11 leading to a five months search for Katura. His luck ran out this Saturday where after being arrested he indicated that he had the money to settle the bill and eventually went on to pay the outstanding balance. He was remanded in custody to tomorrow for sentencing, but it is likely that proprietors of Dzimbahwe Lodge would withdraw the case after recovering the outstanding amount.

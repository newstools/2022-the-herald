The nominations saw 20 entries coming on with two entities expected to be scratched before the race day on June 4. The Bridget Stidolph yard, as usual, brought on board the highest number of entries with six runners, but will face competition from Castle Tankard winner, True Beauty, from the Thomas Mason yard. True Beauty, returns for a double and will have Denis Schwarz, who piloted during the Castle Tankard, as the jockey when they take to the starting stalls. Owned by Ms SP Moyo and Mr G Tafeni, True Beauty is trained by Mason and will only have compatriot Love The View in the race. Speaking at the official unveiling ceremony yesterday, OK Zimbabwe chief executive, Maxen Karombo, said they were  happy to be back and look forward to a good event. “It is with great pleasure that we unveil this year’s edition of the OK Grand Challenge, which will be held on June 4 here at Borrowdale Park. “The OK Grand Challenge is arguably one of the biggest retail promotions in the region, if not in Africa. In 2020 the OK Grand Challenge faced its major hurdle with the unseen global Covid-19 pandemic. ‘’We have a social responsibility towards communities that we operate in as no business exist well without the support of the communities that they are in,” said Karombo.

WORK being done by First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa to eliminate gender-based violence (GBV) and empower women is continuously getting recognition outside the country’s borders with a number of organisations seeking to partner her Angel of Hope Foundation to advance the interests of women. Last week the Sadc regional coordinator for Empire Partner Foundation Ms Carol Shereni paid a courtesy call on the mother of the nation during which she expressed interest in working with her, especially on combating gender-based violence. Mrs Shereni was not empty-handed as she also donated half a tonne of dish- washing liquid to the First Lady for onward distribution to women. The mother of the nation has touched many hearts because of her unconditional love which has enabled her to transform the lives of people countrywide. She has been leading from the front in fighting gender-based violence with a National Gender Based Violence call centre toll free line-575 to curb the scourge operating from her office. Domestic violence often leads to broken families which also presents many social challenges. It is because of the need to curb this that the First Lady has been engaging men countrywide to find amicable ways of resolving domestic disputes without having to resort to violence. Through her Nharirire yeMusha and Gota/Nhanga/Ixhiba programmes the mother of the nation also speaks out candidly against domestic violence which affects the perpetrator, the victim and mostly the children. “On behalf of the Empire Partners Foundation, specifically the End GBV Campaign, we have come and we have met with Amai, Her Excellency the First Lady so that we can partner with Angel of Hope Foundation in its programmes. The foundation is doing great work for women in Zimbabwe, commendable work throughout the nation and for us we are all about empowering women. We want to see gender-based violence eliminated in our nation and we want to see the women of our nation empowered economically and in other ways. This is exactly what our mother is also fighting to achieve, this is her vision, to empower women and to end GBV. We have come so that we can partner Angel of Hope Foundation so we can be a source of hope to Amai’s foundation so that they can continue with the good works they are doing in Zimbabwe. <img class="size-full wp-image-614808" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/Untitled-32.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/Untitled-32.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/Untitled-32-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The dish-washing liquid soap donated to Angel of Hope Foundation “We have also donated dish-washing liquid.

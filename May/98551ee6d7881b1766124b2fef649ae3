Speaking during a press conference yesterday, Zanu PF Youth League acting Deputy Secretary Cde Tendai Chirau said all systems were in place for the successful holding of the elective conference. Some of the issues to be discussed include the state of the economy, the role of youths in party affairs, drugs abuse by youths, sporting activities, religion and culture and youth empowerment. Cde Chirau said one of the key resolutions coming from all the 10 provinces is that President Mnangagwa remains the party’s sole candidate for the 2023 harmonised elections. “This was unanimous,” he said. “All the youth structures adopted the resolution for transforming the country’s economy.” Youth League Secretary for External Affairs Cde Sibongile Sibanda said they had received almost all the invited foreign delegates.

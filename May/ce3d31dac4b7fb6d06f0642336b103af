Accused say they are not a danger to society The accused have since said say they are not a danger to the Diepsloot community and should therefore be released on bail. They also say they do not fear being attacked by the community, as Diepsloot residents have come in large numbers to support them in court. The men are alleged to have robbed some of the victims of their belongings and demanded money in exchange for the release from captivity. They have all denied being part of any crime or mob action that resulted in Nyathi’s death. – SABCNews

The Herald Crime Reporter POLICE have launched an investigation into at least 29 cases of human trafficking that have been reported which involve Zimbabweans who were being lured to the Middle East by a human trafficking ring believed to be working with local fraudsters. During the past months there have been worrisome reports that some Zimbabweans had fallen victim to human trafficking syndicates after being promised lucrative jobs in the Middle East. Most of the victims have been subjected to physical and emotional abuse. In an interview yesterday, national police spokesperson, Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi, said 29 cases of human trafficking have been reported, and the ZRP is working with law enforcement agents in the Middle East and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade to get to the bottom of the matter. “So far 29 cases have been brought to our attention and they involve mostly Zimbabwean nationals in Oman who are being subjected to physical abuse. We also have two cases of Zimbabweans who were assisted to get back and they confirmed that they were being abused,” he said. Asst Comm Nyathi said so far they have arrested two suspects, Francis Mupepeta of Marondera and Tendai Muswe of Harare, on human trafficking charges. The suspects are alleged to be part of a syndicate which also involves locals and foreign nationals.

The Herald LONDON. — Real Madrid’s epic Champions League football semi-final victory over Manchester City on Wednesday night has left the Spanish press stunned. Real Madrid’s astonishing victory over Manchester City has been deemed something “only God can explain’’ by the Spanish press as they delighted in Pep Guardiola’s misery.  The national papers reacted to Real’s dramatic late comeback with incredulity after Carlo Ancelotti’s men staged an unlikely revival when they looked dead and buried. Madrid-based publications took extra pleasure in rubbing salt in former Barcelona boss Guardiola’s wounds. Ancelotti’s side looked to be crashing out of the European Cup after Riyad Mahrez put the Citizens 5-3 up on aggregate in the 73rd minute. But Los Blancos yet again produced another miracle comeback at the Bernabeu, just as they had done in the previous rounds against Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain. Super-sub Rodrygo scored twice in injury time, before French marksman Karim Benzema grabbed his 43rd goal of the campaign in all competitions. The 34-year-old tucked home a penalty in extra-time — his 15th strike in tournament this season — to set up a final clash against 2018 opponents Liverpool. Boss Ancelotti broke down in tears following the incredible win, as he eyes up a fourth Champions League crown in management. Real players celebrated wildly in their dressing room after knocking City out as they danced the night away. Spanish media were left in disbelief after Real secured their place in the final — just days after they secured a record 35th Spanish La Liga title. AS ran the headline: “Real Madrid are from another world’’. They added: “The most sought-after image doesn’t disappoint: Guardiola’s face is GOLD!’’ — The Sun.

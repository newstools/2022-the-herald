The Herald LONDON. — Manchester United have told agents to find the best free transfers this summer — as they do not have a bottomless pit of cash. Interim manager Ralf Rangnick said as many as 10 new players were needed to make the Red Devils competitive again. Incoming boss Erik ten Hag will be given a budget of around £100 million, which is not enough to fund a major overhaul. United have spent £1 billion on players since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. The club’s transfer pot has been hit hard by their failure to qualify for next season’s Champions League football and the knock-on effect of playing behind closed doors due to Covid. But they are aware of the heavy criticism of their scatter-gun spending in the post-Fergie era. So new chief executive Richard Arnold is leading a major overhaul of the recruitment department. Scouting heads Jim Lawlor and Marcel Bout, along with chief negotiator Matt Judge, have gone. — The Sun

The Herald Zvamaida Murwira-Senior Reporter GOVERNMENT has completed four radio station projects while it has embarked on other new projects that include the production of obituaries profiling contributions made by heroes and heroines interred at the National Heroes Acre. This was said by Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Monica Mutsvangwa during a post-Cabinet briefing in Harare yesterday. She said five Ministers presented their 1st 100-Day cycle of 2022 priority projects focusing on several development projects being undertaken by the Second Republic across the country. They include Finance and Economic Development Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube, Industry and Commerce Minister Dr Sekai Nzenza, Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Minister Dr Anxious Masuka, Local Government and Public Works Minister July Moyo and Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Mutsvangwa. Regarding the Ministry of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services, Cabinet heard that there were four community radio stations completed that will complement existing ones. “The Minister of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services, Honourable Monica Mutsvangwa, outlined the progress made on four on-going projects and four new projects in her sector as follows: the four on-going projects are: Nyangani Community Radio Station, Nyanga, Manicaland; Radio Zimbabwe Studios, Mbare, Harare; National University of Science and Technology Campus Radio, Bulawayo; and Lupane State University Campus Radio Station. These projects are now complete and ready for launch,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. Regarding new projects, the Minister said they included the National Development Strategy 1 Spotlight 2021 Production, which seeks to highlight successes of the NDS1. “Secondly, the Zimbabwe-in-brief production is a periodical documentary which seeks to attract Foreign Domestic Investment and guide potential investors and tourists. The publication acts as an authoritative source document for quick reference in Zimbabwe and outside. Zimbabwe-in-Brief Publication will be done in a visual, physical and digital form in order to reach to a wider audience. The third project which is the National Heroes/Heroines Obituaries production involves the production of a more detailed Heroes’ guide by profiling the life histories and contributions of heroes buried at the National Heroes Acres but who are not included in the current guide,” she said. Others include the civil works for the Garawa Community Radio Tower Foundation Construction in Chipinge District that is in progress and commissioning is scheduled for end of May 2022. “This area does not have any existing infrastructure and mobile networks. The Tower will house a community broadcasting transmitter, while mobile network services can be deployed on that Tower thereby improving access to information by these communities,” Minister Mutsvangwa said. The installation of studio equipment for the Nyangani Community Radio Station is complete and installation of transmission equipment is in progress, with commissioning scheduled for end of May 2022. “The outcome of this project will be increased participation by grassroots Nyanga communities in local and national affairs as well as enhancing diversity and pluralism in radio broadcasting. The community radio station will cater for the Chihwesa speaking communities in Nyanga,” Minister Mutsvangwa said. <img class="size-full wp-image-607836" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Untitled-40-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Untitled-40-1.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Untitled-40-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Information, Publicity and Broadcast Services Minister Monica Mutsvangwa Installation of NUST and Lupane State University campus radio stations and related works are in progress.

The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter BORROWDALE Park and racecourse will come alive this morning when the Premier horseracing event  in Zimbabwe — the Castle Tankard — takes place with 12 runners taking to the starting stalls in the main race. The 63rd edition of the race meet is sponsored to the turn of US$50 000 by Delta Beverages through their Castle Lager brand. Defending champion, Three To Tango of the Debra Swanson yard, will once again be tested by 11 other runners and the six-year-old has so far won seven races from 1200m to 2400m, including the 1600m Tote Free Handicap and the 2020 Zimbabwe Derby. Three To Tango will have competition from favourite Only Him and Finchanton from Gokhan Terzi stable who have been doing well in distances of the range. By Mambo In Seattle (USA), Bridget Stidolph’s charge Only Him has won four of his nine Borrowdale starts from 1200m to 2400m, including the 2021 Zimbabwe Derby, and when he did not win, Only Him has usually been in close contention. With Stidolph yard bringing in the numbers, they will also have three-year-old Wantage, illustrious stable companion Lily Blue and Citrusdal to contend with. Vanessa Birketoft fields three runners in the Castle Tankard with Holy Land as the favourite and will be complemented by Mr Greenlight and Armstrong. Holy Land was originally trained by Dennis Drier, and campaigned extensively in KwaZulu Natal and Gauteng, where he won a 1600m Maiden Plate at Greyville in September 2018. His next victory was 1600m Independence Trophy at Borrowdale Park in June 2020 when he was trained by Thomas Mason. Swanson charges will also bring in Heir Line and Buggati Blue as Thomas Mason will have two runners in True Beauty and Love The View. Four-year-old True Beauty faces the toughest test of her career but always gives her best. Her five wins include the 1200m Jacaranda Free Handicap and the 1600m Tote Free, and she was a close second to Dindingwe in the 2021 Zimbabwe Guineas (Gr3). True Beauty has been in Mason stable since December and has won twice, over 1600m and 1700m while stablemate Love The View is a new arrival after taking part in South Africa previously. There are seven races today with the first race starting at 11:50am. The main race – the Castle Tankard — will start at 3:50pm.

The Herald “Rocky” star Sylvester Stallone is selling his abode in La Quinta, California, for US$3,35 million, about $1,15 million less than what he paid for it a decade ago. The Mediterranean — and Tuscan — style villa has 4 889 square feet of interior space, including four bedrooms and five baths, according to the listing with Josh Reef of Douglas Elliman, who listed the property last Wednesday. The two-storey home, built in 2008, also offers a spacious living room with double-height ceilings and a stone fireplace, a dining room that opens to a terrace, a kitchen with wood cabinets, a wood-and-stone centre island, a breakfast room and a wine room, according to the listing. Stallone, 73, an actor, screenwriter, director and painter, bought the property in 2010 for US$4,5 million via a trust, property records show. He first listed it for US$4,2 million in 2014. Since then, the home had been on and off the market at different prices with changes of brokers. It was taken off the market in 2016, when it was last listed at US$3,625 million, listing records show. Listing agent Reef said Stallone and his family used the home for desert vacations, and the property is well maintained. — Los Angeles Times

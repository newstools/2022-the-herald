HUNDREDS of people in Mashonaland Central including ladies of the night, widows, members of child-headed families and the disabled yesterday completed training in detergent-making thanks to First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa, who through her Angel of Hope Foundation and its partners, has rolled out life-changing empowerment programmes for the people. The First Lady has a passion for the empowerment of the nation and recently received a Doctor of Philosophy Degree from G.D Goenka University of India in recognition of her efforts. Those who completed training were given certificates of completion from the Angel of Hope Foundation and starter-packs to immediately set up their projects. They made petroleum jelly, dishwashing liquid and toilet cleaners among other products. Amai Mnangagwa, who is also the country’s health ambassador, is working flat out to take ladies of the night off the streets as she continues with her drive of leaving no one behind. The aim is to rehabilitate and economically empower them so that they leave the world’s oldest profession. In addition, the women were given food hampers and toiletries by the First Lady who also gave goodies to everyone who attended. She encouraged them to work hard to shake off poverty. “No one should complain that they have failed to get a market. Apply your mind to it and see how successful you will become. Change your thoughts and start seeing yourself as a businesswoman in Mashonaland Central Province. Poverty is fought through hard work and among you some will emerge successful as others lag behind.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-618568 aligncenter" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/2-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/2-1.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/2-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “Your thoughts will differentiate you. Let us work hard as women and your determination will take you far. As your mother, I am here to help you succeed and I am convinced that things will work out if we work hard. “I have given you starter packs because I understand that most of you have nowhere to start from. Do not waste your capital because business capital is not for spending but for work,” she emphasised. Dr Mnangagwa said it was her wish to see women succeed without pulling each other down. “I want to believe you had a good time learning and took down notes during the lectures. We use dishwasher, toilet cleaner and petroleum jelly on a daily basis hence you already have a market,” she said. A representative from the Ministry of Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development said to complement the First Lady’s efforts, the Ministry will help the women to market their products as it had ready markets in and outside the country. Mrs Tsitsi Denhera, a widow, sang praises to the First Lady for the empowerment programme saying she was having difficulties looking after her children but would now work hard because she had been empowered through the course and starter-pack. “I am grateful for what the First Lady has done for us. I was facing challenges looking after my children and will use this project to earn a living and raise school fees for my children. May God grant her more years to see the success of the empowerment programmes she has initiated,” she said. In an earlier interface with the First Lady, ladies of the night expressed willingness to quit the world’s oldest profession and earn clean money through using their hands as espoused by Dr Mnangagwa. In a frank and constructive discussion with the First Lady, ladies of the night said they had had enough of the risky occupation which exposed them to abuse, diseases and even death. <img class="size-full wp-image-618571" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/3-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/3-1.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/3-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Beneficiaries of First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa’s empowerment programmes through her Angel of Hope Foundation display their certificates in detergents making, their starter packs and food hampers after their training in Mavhuradonha on Friday. Amai Mnangagwa, who has a passion for uplifting women, fought back tears as the ladies of the night narrated how they ended up doing sex work and some of the challenges they face. One of the women said she started doing commercial sex work after the death of her husband. “I am 41-years-old and I have three children. Life has been difficult for me. My mother also died when we were young such that the burden of looking after my siblings were on my shoulders. “I started commercial sex work to look after my siblings and my children. In this job I encountered countless problems. “My daughter was raped by our neighbour at the age of five after I had gone to the club and fell into a coma for 65 days. I was also raped in Mbare by five men who took turns to abuse me. I thank the First Lady for what she has done for us today. Our mother has done a wonderful thing for us, the down-trodden. She has shown a real mother’s love and introduced us to work that requires the use of our hands so that after training we can fend for ourselves. This will assist even our children at home. For some of us, ladies of the night, our children also end up doing the same after learning these bad habits from us. Amai has given us a second chance and we promise to work hard so that we do not disappoint her,” she said amid sobs. Similar sentiments were shared by a 34-year-old lady of the night who was plying her trade in Rushinga. “I live in Rushinga Township. I was once married but we ran into marital challenges and I decided to venture into sex work. During this period, I came across a client who robbed me at knife-point. I do not want my child to know that I am doing this for survival and I am thankful to the First Lady for the project so that I can walk away from this profession,” she said. Another 46-year-old lady also shared her story. <img class="size-full wp-image-618573" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/4-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/4-1.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/4-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> UNAIDS Country Director Sophia Mukasa Monico address ladies of the night while First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa and Minister of State and Devolution for Mashonaland Central Monica Mavhunga look on during an interactive session on Friday. “I stay in Chipadze, Bindura, and was once married in Harare with four kids. My husband got into an accident and died on the spot. My children were left at tender ages when the last born was 11 months old. All the responsibilities fell squarely on my shoulders because I used to rely on my husband for everything. This forced me to delve into sex work. Some men rob us and leave us with nothing. Amai, I thank you for this programme which will enable me to cater for my family. At times some men sleep with us and refuse to pay,” she said. Her 28-year-old colleague, who has one child and lives in Chiwaridzo also gave a brief account of herself. She said she lost her friend after they were hit by a speeding driver during the night while coming from a night club. She sustained serious injuries and her friend died on the spot. In her brief remarks, Dr Mnangagwa said she was concerned with the welfare of women, hence her intervention. “I have come so that we discuss as a mother and her daughters because the challenges you encounter are painful to my heart. The National Aids Council (NAC) is saying by 2030 it intends to eradicate new infections and this is only possible if you quit risky behaviour. The job you are doing will bring diseases and death. I understand you started this work due to different circumstances. I want you to leave this and start using your hands to look after your families in a proper way. I have come here out of zeal and love for you. Today, we want to end prostitution. Together with my Angel of Hope Foundation and its partners, I want you to use your hands. This requires hardworking people who are committed. I was pained by the ages that are already into sex work like 14-year-olds. I want us to do something tangible and I partnered the Zimbabwe Open University (ZOU) to offer you free courses. We want you to enter boardrooms and not bedrooms. I want you to form groups and start projects. We also have the Women’s Bank where you can access loans and grow your business. When I was still an MP, I started a women’s bank ‘Mikando’ and women achieved a lot. Some bought houses, cars and sent their children to school. Can you not achieve this feat?” she said to thunderous applause. <img class="size-full wp-image-618576" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/5-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/5-1.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/5-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Beneficiaries of First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa’s empowerment programmes label the various detergents they made during their training in Mavhuradonha on Friday. UNAIDS country director Mrs Sofia Mukasa Monico praised the Government of Zimbabwe for the strides it has made in fighting HIV/Aids and said much more can be achieved through commitment. She commended Amai Mnangagwa for her programmes, which are beneficial to the nation. “I really want to take this opportunity also to share with you that Zimbabwe through the Government of Zimbabwe has done a lot. Out of the 1,3 million people living with HIV nearly 1,2 million are already on treatment. Out of those who are on treatment most of them are doing very well. Let us also take advantage of the available services let us make sure that we access treatment, let us make sure that we prevent HIV infection not only HIV, unwanted pregnancies. We are talking about sexually transmitted diseases. This is why Amai is working flat out to remove you from the streets. Above all through you Amai let us contribute to the process of restoring and improving the quality of life of all those people infected and affected by HIV in Zimbabwe,” she said.

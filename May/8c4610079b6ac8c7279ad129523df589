DUBAI-BASED middle-distance runner Royal Mabika says he is keen to represent his country in the near future. The 26-year-old athlete last week won bronze in the SuperSports Race 6, Meydan, The Track in Dubai. This year he has also participated in the Emirati Hatta half marathon with a time of 1 hour 5 minutes 26 seconds and the Ras Al Khaimah, where he clocked 1:06:22. Mabika is going to take part in the Great Davos 10km in Switzerland next month. “As an athlete based in the Middle East, I am very confident of representing my nation in the near future because that’s what I am pushing for. I am taking it very seriously. “Like any other athlete, I am working on the goals as well as the times,” he said. Mabika lamented that sponsorship was a big issue for the local runners. However, he has been fortunate that he has been able to get assistance. His dream is to invest in sports infrastructure in his rural home of Zaka. “The biggest challenge that we face as long distance runners is sponsorship. It is not easy to get someone to help you rise especially if you are still working on getting the good times. “I have been fortunate enough and l want to thank God that l have met a lot of people who have impacted positively on my running. “Recently l was invited for a sports development conference with some organisation in Qatar. “I have the ambition to help develop the sport in the rural areas because l believe there are many talented people but they never get exposure. “I have met with people who are eager to fund my dream of building a sports centre in Zaka Jerera, in a partnership with the local rural district council. “It’s high time we call out the international community to come and help us grow the sporting environment that we want,” said Mabika.

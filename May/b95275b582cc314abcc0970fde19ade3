The Herald Sports Reporter A POOR batting display came back to haunt the Zimbabwe XI cricket team yesterday following a five-wicket defeat by visiting South Africa ‘A’ at Harare Sports Club yesterday. The hosts were bowled out for 114 runs inside 19.5 overs after they were asked to bat first. Although the tourists were not as clinical in their response, they still managed to get the job done after reaching 115/5 with 14 balls remaining. Debutant Tristan Stubbs struck 39 off 37 balls to take South Africa ‘A’ over the line as the Zimbabweans fought back strongly with the ball. The hosts, however, had shot themselves in the foot earlier on with their frail batting. They suffered the first setback when Wesley Madhevere, who had opened the batting with Takudzwanashe Kaitano, was caught and bowled by Bjorn Fortuin for just 10 runs. Then Craig Ervine went out for a single run after facing 10 balls. Kaitano, who was the top scorer with 20 runs, followed him to the pavilion soon to leave Zimbabwe at 42/3 after 6.3 overs. Wickets continued to tumble at regular intervals with Sikandar Raza (16 from 15) and Milton Shumba getting dismissed two balls apart as Zimbabwe slid to 71/5. The lower middle order could not hold as well as Zimbabwe XI battled to get past the 100 runs mark. Glenton Stuurman took 3-18 while Fortuin had 2-17 for the victorious tourists. The South Africans now lead the five-match series 1-0. The next game will be played tomorrow at the same venue. Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe A side on tour of Nepal had their second T20 match abandoned yesterday due to rains. Some fine hitting by Tadiwanashe Marumani and Kudzai Maunze was the main feature of this second unofficial T20 international against Nepal at Kirtipur, which lasted exactly 4.3 overs before rain descended and wiped out the rest of the match. Nepal won the toss and put the visitors in to bat. Zimbabwe A lost Innocent Kaia this time to the second ball of the innings, caught off the bowling of Sompal Kami. Maunze then joined Marumani at the crease and the pair proceeded to hit 47 runs off just 24 balls before Marumani was caught, having hit two sixes and a four in scoring 21 off 11 balls. There was just time for Roy Kaia to come in and score a single off his first ball before the rain came. Maunze was on 22 not out off 13 balls, with five fours, and Zimbabwe A had already established a very promising position. RESULT: South Africa A won by 5 wickets Zimbabwe XI 114 all out in 19.5 overs (Kaitano 20, Raza 16; Stuurman 3-18, Fortuin 2-17) South Africa A 115/5 in 17.4 overs (Stubbs 39*, Zondo 23; Chivanga 2-11, Chatara 1-14)

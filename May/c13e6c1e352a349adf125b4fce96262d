The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter ALL roads will lead to Kadoma’s Odyssey Hotel for the rebranded 2022 edition of the Mr and Ms Ironman on May 28. For seven years Kadoma has been waiting and the wait is over now with the National Association of Zimbabwe Bodybuilding and Fitness Association (NFZBBF) ready to host the second event of the year. After successfully hosting the Mr and Ms Novice, attention has since shifted to the Mr and Ms Ironman which will see more than five categories up for grabs. The last time Kadoma hosted a bodybuilding show was in 2015 and Botswana-based Champion Chienderamwano won the bodybuilding division while Regina Jonga won what was then referred to as women bodybuilding. Precious Mujuru went home as the winner of the figure division as Raymond Mutandiri won the junior men division while Godwin Simbarashe Mhaka and Shama Mugava won Men’s Physique and Men’s Fitness respectively. The event’s main highlight was obviously one of the best rivalry of all time which had Blessing Samaringa and Isaac “Sugar” Chimuchenga who went on to place second and third respectively. ZNFBBF secretary-general, Quiet Shangai, believes there will be a tough contest as there is another Samaringa who is likely to take to the podium. “While 1999 Mr Zimbabwe Bodybuilding champion, Tobias Madzime, believes Blessing is our own Frank Zane, I think he is Mr Physique and at the same time Shawn Ray of our time in terms of his career. “He is the uncrowned National champion as well as the uncrowned Ironman champion. Don’t get me wrong, the system never robbed him at least according to my own opinion but he competed in what I would call the golden generation. “It’’s very clear that Blessing will not compete on May 28 but there is another Samaringa who will definitely be on stage. 2018 national middleweight bodybuilding champion, Eliah Samaringa will be seeking to become the first Samaringa to win Ironman Zimbabwe,” said Shangai.

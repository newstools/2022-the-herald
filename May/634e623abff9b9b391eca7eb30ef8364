The Herald There’s a quiet regality whenever Kate Henshaw is on screen. No matter the character, you can’t help but just want to bow in her presence. Now imagine seeing her in person? She commands respect. That was my feeling when I met the Nigerian actress in March at Netflix’s “The Bridgerton” Affair event in Johannesburg. It felt like she was gliding in her Lady Danbury co-splay outfit. I then bumped into her the next morning during breakfast with Nse Ikpe-Etim. Once again, I was spellbound. It then makes sense that she was cast as the matriarch in Nigeria’s first Netflix original drama, “Blood Sisters”. The mini-series, produced by Mo Abudu’s EbonyLife, is a dark drama about the endemic nature of domestic violence in our society and how many people suffer in silence for fear of not being believed. It does not shy away from the role that families play in allowing domestic violence to continue by covering up the perpetrator’s actions and forcing the victims to keep quiet. It’s a reality that is so common for many people around the globe. It is also nuanced storytelling, showing how complex the issue of gender based violence is, even with the glossy background of a wealthy family and their scions who do despicable things and are able to get away with it because of the power they wield. It shows the power that parents have over their children and the lengths they go to cover up their crimes and misdeeds. Sarah (Ini Dima Okojie) must have thought her dreams were coming true when she met Kola Ademola (Deyemi Okanlawon) from the powerful Ademola family. iolnews.com

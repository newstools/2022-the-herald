The tournament was supposed to be held in Hong Kong, but the Covid-19 pandemic and related restrictions forced a move to Dubai. Tornadoes finished third in the final log standings at the end of the preliminary round robin games. They then upstaged Barmy Army Women by four wickets in the semi-finals. Tornadoes won the toss and elected to field first in the final against Falcons, who went on to score 151/4 in their 20 overs, thanks to a huge 67 from South African all-rounder Marizanne Kapp. Musonda’s teammates managed to overhaul the target with five balls remaining after reaching 152/2 and bagging the title.

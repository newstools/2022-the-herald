The Herald ZIMBABWE international football striker Admiral Muskwe’s dream of winning promotion to the English Premier League is over after his Luton Town side lost to Huddersfield on Monday night. The Hatters suffered a 1-0 defeat to lose the tie 2-1 on aggregate and miss out on a place in the English Championship football play-off final. Luton were the better side for long periods on the night but Jordan Rhodes’ late strike won the fixture for Huddersfield. Muskwe was not part of the matchday squad on Monday night and also for the first leg. But the Warriors international featured in the final round of the league season against Reading as they finished on number 6. Meanwhile, Huddersfield will face the winner between Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United in the play-offs final. The winner of the final will earn a promotion to the English Premier League and join Fulham and Bournemouth. The Cherries, who have Zimbabwean defender Jordan Zemura on their books, secured an automatic promotion after finishing second while Fulham took the first spot. Muskwe missed Monday night’s match through injury. Versatile forward Muskwe joined the Hatters from English Premier League side Leicester City for an undisclosed fee in July 2021. Nathan Jones’ eighth signing of the summer spent the second half of last season on-loan at Wycombe Wanderers, scoring three goals in 13 appearances as the Chairboys were relegated to League One. Muskwe made his international debut for Zimbabwe in 2017 and has represented England at Under-16 and Under-17 level, making his debut for the former at the age of 15. The then Leicester City forward scored 23 times in 71 appearances in the PL2 whilst also featuring in the EFL Trophy, scoring six goals in 14 appearances. — Soccer24

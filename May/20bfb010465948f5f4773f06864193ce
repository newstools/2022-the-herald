The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo Senior Lifestyle Writer “A mother is a walking miracle.” No more words can surpass these. Tomorrow is Mothers’ Day, a special occasion aimed at celebrating women across the world for shaping society. Women are known to be hard workers who are toiling tirelessly to fend for families, yet their efforts sometimes go unnoticed in their lifetime. The majority of such women of valour cry in privacy and put on a smile in public just to cheer up their children. There are some mothers who, despite experiencing barrenness, have gone to the extent of adopting other people’s children to ensure that they give them a good life. All this is out of love from people who have the keys to make the world a better place. On home turf, this day is special and tomorrow we do expect people to share special moments with their mothers. To those who lost their mothers, tomorrow is the day they would want to easily forget. <img class="size-medium wp-image-615741" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/gdbdh-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="201" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/gdbdh-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/gdbdh.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> Prim Kurima and sons Chikomborero and Takomborerwa However, others who have lost their mothers celebrate their heroines for all the good things they did in their lives. A survey by The Herald on Saturday Lifestyle has revealed that from today a lot of events have been lined up to celebrate the special day. One local floral company dubbed “FloriqueZw” is hosting a Mother’s Day “brunch” at Meikles Hotel tomorrow where they have invited television personality and motivational speaker Rebecca Chisamba, affectionately known as Mai Chisamba, who is expected to share her journey as a mother. She will share the stage with seasoned pastor Grace Kupswara. In an interview, event host Yolanda Moyo said all was set for the “brunch” and mothers should be celebrated daily. She said they decided to empower women through motivational sessions. “We are much used to the kitchen parties and wedding events where women are educated and empowered, but this Mother’s Day why not do something different,” she said.  “My mother doesn’t stay in Harare, but she will be coming to the “brunch”. It will be a very beautiful day with powerful and inspiring conversations in the company of mothers.” Moyo will be spending time with her son after the “brunch”. “My mother is the most loving person, a superwoman who has influenced and inspired everything I am today,” she said. “The book of life can never be complete without mentioning the inspirational role of a mother.” Again at Swan Creek Gardens, there is also “A Hat Affair” taking place where mothers are expected to come dressed in hats and will have a photo shoot. The event will see socialite Felistas Murata, affectionately known as Mai Titi, taking part. Hairdresser and make-up artist Prim Kurima said Mother’s Day was special and she too was expecting something from her two boys. “I think I will be busy in the kitchen with my boys Chikomborero and Takomborerwa cooking tomorrow,” she said. “They are still very young and obviously the greatest gift I can get from them is love. I will take them out as part of celebrating myself. A mother is a special person.” Singer Janet Manyowa, who was recently elected into the ZIMURA board, said the day was worth celebrating and she would not let it pass unnoticed. <img class="size-medium wp-image-615738" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/Untitled-2.jpjaneteg-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="201" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/Untitled-2.jpjaneteg-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/Untitled-2.jpjaneteg.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> Janet Manyowa and her mother Rachel Manyeza “I will spend Mother’s Day with family and my children, I will also take time to celebrate and honour my mothers – biological and mother-in-law. They are both very special to me,” she said. The “Zadzisa” hit maker said she has a lot of respect for her mother. “My mother is the pillar of my life, she is everything to me,” said Manyowa. “She set very high standards for me and moulded me to be the person I am today. I appreciate her for her strictness and creative edge, love and above all prayerfulness. “I’m grateful to God for her life, for all her sacrifices, and for moulding me into the woman I am today. Like any other child, she said she was willing to make her mother happy. She also revealed the gifts that she wishes to give her mother should God and funds permit. “Gifts can never be enough to appreciate my mother. I pray for good health and long life for her, but one day I will buy her a Rolls Royce.” Manyowa said women needed to be honoured every day for the role they played in society. “The contribution of women in society is invaluable,” she said. “Women are an integral part of society. Being the primary caretakers of children and the elderly, they are the pioneers of a nation. We don’t appreciate the role enough.” Another artiste, Mudiwa Hood, who still claims to be “mama’s boy” despite being a grown up approaching the 40s. The rapper, who has on many occasions praised his mother, said he would not let the Mothers’ Day just pass like any other day. The “Ndaita Mari” singer said his mother remains his pillar. “My mum is my everything,” said Mudiwa Hood. “She sacrificed her own dream just so I could have mine. She has always been there for me in everything and is a shoulder to lean on when I need comfort. “After my divorce, she offered to help me raise my child. She is beyond comparison, the place she holds in my heart is hers alone and will never have a replacement. I love you mum.” Mudiwa Hood, who is known for pampering his mother with gifts, couldn’t be drawn into revealing what he has in store for her. “It is a big surprise I have lined up for her,” he said. Mudiwa Hood said he had not given up on what he wished to offer his mother as a gift.  “I would love to surprise her with a mansion, surely I will fulfil this, if God permits. To cement my respect, I am releasing a song called  ‘Amai Vakandirera’ on Monday, the video.” A 45-year-old vendor, Ms Pauline Makurume from Mufakose, Harare, said she has been saving money to buy her mother a blanket that she always wanted. “I know things are tight, but I have to make it up to her,” she said. “There is this blanket she has been talking about for almost six months now and I want to surprise her. “I have been saving money, I wanted to surprise her on her birthday last month, but due to the issue of school fees I had to save the best for the last.”

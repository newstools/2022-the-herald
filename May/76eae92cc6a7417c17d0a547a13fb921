The Herald LONDON.  — Arsenal are closing in on a £40 million deal for Leicester star Youri Tielemans. But Real Madrid would be waiting to pounce on the Belgian midfielder should the Gunners fail to qualify for the Champions League football. However there is growing confidence from the player’s camp and the Emirates club that Tielemans will be an Arsenal player next season. Gunners boss Mikel Arteta wants to boost the quality and depth of his midfield options this summer. Tielemans would be an upgrade on both Granit Xhaka, whose future at the Emirates is uncertain, and Mohamed Elneny, with his contract expiring this summer. Leicester are all but resigned to selling the man whose goal won them the FA Cup last season. Tielemans (25) has turned down offers of a new contract and his current deal has just over a year to run. The Foxes would rather cash in now, than risk losing the player for nothing. Manchester United were also strongly linked with Tielemans but their chances of winning the race to sign him have faded as their challenge for a top-four place flopped. Tielemans, whose previous clubs are Anderlecht and Monaco, has made no secret of his desire to play Champions League football. If Arsenal are able to offer that next season, then it is increasingly likely they will get their man. Tielemans was in action on Thursday night as the Foxes were eliminated from the Europa Conference League. He has made 154 appearances for Leicester, including 46 this season. — The Sun.

Players in education, health and tourism were well represented at the colourful event as the mother of the nation spearheads efforts of improved children’s education, especially the girl child. Amai Mnangagwa’s Angel of Hope Foundation works with various stakeholders to pay fees for children in vulnerable communities and run a school feeding scheme to ensure no child pulls out of school because of hunger. “Allow me to call you esteemed friends after the glamorous welcome of yesterday,” she said. “Your presence here is ample testimony of your commitment to Zimbabwe as articulated to me by the Ambassador. “Indeed, it is an honour to welcome you to this briefing session on activities of the Angel of Hope Foundation, of which I am Patron. It has been a long road since its inception in 2018. It has not been an easy road ,but worth the while. With committed friends I am certain we will achieve more.” To hammer her points home, the First Lady played well-packaged video clips highlighting some of the projects that she is undertaking through her foundation since inception in 2018. In the video clips were projects and programmes on cancer screening outreach programmes, environmental protection, Covid-19 awareness, the school feeding programmes, child protection, empowerment programmes and working with the marginalised communities. Also featured were programmes targeting people living with disabilities, tourism and education among many other Angel of Hope programmes. Most of the organisations and individuals that met the First Lady were represented at the highest level.

Dr Senoritah Isaac said she was awestruck by the amount of work the First Lady was carrying out across the length and breadth of Zimbabwe. “We are very grateful to her for coming here and after watching the videos of the amount of work that she is doing, we are very excited to work with her,” she said. “Definitely we want to extend our gratitude to her and I have rarely seen people doing the amount of work she is doing in many areas. Definitely we want to collaborate on cancer and her women empowerment schemes. It is an honour to come to be her to communicate and meet her.” Dr Isaac later held a closed-door meeting with the First Lady from which they emerged talking about the need for the two foundations – Angel of Hope and Human Achievers Foundation to strengthen ties in terms of health and women empowerment with Dr Isaac expressing her willingness to visit Zimbabwe for the first time. “I have never visited Zimbabwe and would love to and see the great work you are doing for the people of Zimbabwe,” she said. “As a Foundation, we are willing to work with you such that when you need something you can let us know. “I also have some groups of ladies that I work with all over the world who are also willing to support Angel of Hope Foundation in its charity work for the benefit of the people of Zimbabwe.” In response, the First Lady chronicled the various works she is doing on health and for the empowerment of womenfolk, especially the girl child. “We have met as mothers and when mothers meet, we begin to understand each other,” she said. “What you have said about health, is what my foundation is also doing. We are also into women and girl child empowerment because what we have just noticed in our country is that because of Covid-19, most of the girls have dropped out of school. “We can’t leave them like that, we teach them some empowerment skills. And coming to health issues, I travel the breadth and length of the country educating our women how important it is for them to know their reproductive health and how they should be checked time and again against cervical cancer because when cancer comes it causes challenges.” The mother of the nation said late health checks often resulted in diseases like cancer being diagnosed when it is at the last stage which becomes difficult to suppress. Amai Mnangagwa is the country’s health ambassador. Also charmed by the First Lady’s presentation and works was Mr Shailendra Jain, who said they were looking at various areas to partner the mother of the nation for the benefit of Zimbabweans. “It is really an honour to have the First Lady visiting India and New Delhi being her first stop, we are really glad and we are very grateful for all the great work that she is doing and we are looking at various ways to connect with her in various development programmes,” she said. “Her commitment towards human development is really exhaustive, it is very comprehensive. Her hands-on approach and care for women empowerment and access to basic health care for all is unmatched. “She is a very powerful model and we believe there is a lot of synergy between what India does and what Africa does, mainly Zimbabwe through Her Excellency, the First Lady. Zimbabwe seems to be really doing like a pioneer in the space we wish her luck and success in her future endeavours.” Speaking along, Ms Jyoti Sawhney one of the founders of Bharat Business Connect, said they felt honoured to work closely with the First Lady given that she was transforming the lives of the people for the better. <img class="size-full wp-image-615373" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/FL4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/FL4.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/FL4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Indian business executives and leaders of charity organisations follow proceedings during their meeting and interaction with First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa in New Delhi, India, yesterday. “I welcome the First Lady to India and we are really honoured to be here and we are looking forward to boosting bilateral relations with Zimbabwe,” she said. “She is doing lovely, she is doing amazing work which she is doing through her Angel of Hope Foundation and after meeting her today (yesterday) we now know much more about what she is doing and see how we can be a part of it too. “We would like to help the people of Zimbabwe through the Angel of Hope Foundation of which the First Lady is the patron.

The First Lady’s visit, the Ambassador added, came at a time when India was emerging as a hub of global diplomacy and for Zimbabwe to be part of this positive trend, was commendable. This is not the first time for Amai Mnangagwa to be invited to other countries by organisations and individuals who are charmed by her charity work and willing to work with her. Only recently, she was invited for the Eurasian Women’s Economic Forum in St Petersburg, Russia, in recognition of her philanthropic work where the Speaker of the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation Madam Valentina Matviyenko showed keen interest in exploring partnerships with the Angel of Hope Foundation. <img class="size-full wp-image-615376" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/FL5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/FL5.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/FL5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa has a heart-to-heart conversation with Dr Shilpi Chandra in New Delhi, India, yesterday.

She was also invited to China by the Chinese business executives where they held fruitful discussions on investment in Zimbabwe and partnering with Angel of Hope Foundation in its programmes that are aimed at helping the country’s citizenry. With the volumes of people spellbound by the First Lady’s initiatives across the globe, there is no doubt that she is moving in the right direction.

The Herald LONDON. — Arsenal have submitted a £43 million offer for Manchester City striker Gabriel Jesus, according to reports. Jesus’ agent confirmed transfer talks with the Gunners earlier this week, admitting the player likes the project at the North London club.GOAL report that a bid has been “formalised” and that negotiations are “close to an end”. The deal for Jesus (25) has been “sewn together” by fellow Brazilian and technical director Edu. The striker’s game time under Pep Guardiola will be limited with City announcing the signing of Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund. And now it appears that the Gunners are stepping up their pursuit of the forward, who has 95 goals for Man City. Jesus could be allowed to depart the Etihad to avoid losing him on a free transfer with his contract to expire in 2023. Should he join Arsenal, he would be reunited with Arteta, who he worked with at City when the Spaniard was Guardiola’s No. 2. Jesus isn’t the only City star that Arsenal are said to be keen on, with winger Raheem Sterling a reported target. — The Sun.

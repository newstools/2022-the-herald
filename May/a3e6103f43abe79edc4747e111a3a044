The Herald Business Reporter Over $500 billion was wiped off the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) as the market retreated further into the red during the week to Wednesday, March 11, 2022, latest data shows. Apparently, the market reacted partly to pronouncements by President Mnangagwa on planned Government measures to defend further depreciation of the Zimbabwe dollar and tame rising inflation. The measures included the suspension of lending by banks, to private sector, public sector and individuals with immediate effect and the increase in capital gains tax to 40 percent on ZSE shares held for less than 270 days and 20 percent for shares held more than 270 days. Finance and Economic Development Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube said on Wednesday, in an interview with ZTN’s “The Mint Special” programme, that the measures were designed to prick the bubble of speculative currency and equities trading, which has been stocking inflation. Economist Eddie Cross said the retreat in the ZSE market cap was likely a direct response to measures announced by the Government to deal with malfeasance in the stock and the currency markets. He said the former was the best performing stock exchange in Africa in March, though largely driven by speculative trading. “I think that is a direct consequence of the measures. I think that people have been looking for a place to put money and the stock market has been one of them (amid inflation surge). The other place has been the US dollar and I think the measures adopted by the President make it much less attractive to put (speculative) money in the stock market. “I can see two consequences; one is a retreat in the performance of the stock market. Our stock market was the best performing stock market in Africa in March and I think we are gonna see the stock market retreat (in self correction), but at the same time we will see the parallel market rate retreat as well,” he said. By the end of the week to Wednesday, the market’s total value had retreated by 14 percent to $2,99 trillion from $3,4 trillion in the previous week.

Jere seid Jones will be tasked with setting up structures to ensure the club achieves its short-term and long-term goals. “We are here to introduce Charlie as our new chief executive officer, in line with our structure and in line with our plan which we had before Covid-19. “So we appointed a chief executive officer after a very rigorous exercise. There were so many people who were interested in this position and obviously we settled for one. We are very happy to say we managed to trace out roots and he is one of the yesteryear heroes that earned CAPS United the nickname of Cup Kings. He is here with us today and will take over the reins in the running of the club starting from today, ” said Jere. Jones played football at the top level when he turned out as a speedy right-winger for Makepekepe and the now defunct Arcadia United.

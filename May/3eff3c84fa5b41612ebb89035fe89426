The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo Senior Arts Reporter About 20 local artistes are set to take part in the 10-day exhibition dubbed “Go Nature, Go Exhibition” at Alliance Francaise. The exhibition, which will be hosted by George Mgona Art for Conservation Trust (GMAC Trust), will run from May 17 to 27, with artists from painters, stone sculptors, guitarists, poets to photographers taking part. In an interview with The Herald Arts, founder member of the Turst, George Mgona, said all was set for the show beginning today. He said the show was part of the visual artistes promotion and this was a return leg to Harare as last year it was hosted in Bulawayo. “It is all systems go,” said Mgona. “We are ready and I am happy that the 20 artistes who confirmed have started putting in place their artwork for exhibition. “We once hosted a similar show in Bulawayo last October running with the same theme ‘Go Nature, Go Exhibition’ and the selected artistes were expected to present their works based on the theme.” Mgona said the aim of the exhibition was to raise awareness about conserving the environment and wildlife. “The official opening is on today and our guests have confirmed their participation,” he said. “Our guest of honour is the manager for National Community Conservation at Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Agency, Dorris Tom. “We are saying to the community that it is high time we have to take care of our environment for it to take care of us tomorrow. ‘‘We believe that the future is not a place we walk into, but rather a place that we craft ourselves. “Environmental degradation, climate change and soil erosion among others, but a few are disasters that we as humans have a hand in making because of our behaviours towards the environment. “For this reason, we stand for the education of proper natural resource management for the good of our children tomorrow.”

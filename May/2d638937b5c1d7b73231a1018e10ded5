The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter NEWLY-APPOINTED Trojan Stars coach Ralph Kawondera has since shifted focus to finish in the top four of the ZIFA Northern Region Division One Soccer League after his side’s fine run in the Axis Solutions Super 8 Cup was brought to a halt by Golden Eagles at Ellis Robbins on Sunday . Kawondera’s team was knocked out of the Axis Solutions Super 8 Cup by Golden Eagles whose coach Gilbert Mushangazhike is now looking for double as he has a chance of clinching promotion at the end of the season. The two teams clashed in the semi-finals of the tournament at Ellis Robbins on Sunday with a Raymond Uchena 19th minute strike proving the difference. Kawondera, who had joined Trojan Stars four days before the match, was happy with his charges performance and believes there is room for improvement. “I think we played well and we could not maximise on the chances we created. We will work on that as we go back to the league which we are targeting a top four finish. “There are some grey areas which we need to work on and I hope this window period will help us. I had worked with the team for four days before the match but I think we did well. “We will now shift our focus to the league which is coming back soon after this Super 8 Cup. Our intention is to finish in the top four as this is our comeback season,” said Kawondera. Meanwhile, Mushangazhike, whose Golden Eagles side will face Simba Bhora in the final, said he is looking to complete the job and getting the cup and promotion will be good for them. “Another task completed we are so happy and we now await the final against Simba Bhora. The boys did very well and I hope we will continue with the fine form when the league resumes. “We managed to utilise the chance we created although we could have done better considering the chances we created,” said Mushangazhike.

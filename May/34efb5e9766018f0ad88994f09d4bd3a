The Herald Lesego Valela Arts Reporter SOUTH Africa based Afro pop singer, Panashe “Drika” Viriri, is determined to raise the Zimbabwean flag high in foreign lands. The 21-year-old, who has made an impact in West Africa before settling in South Africa, has also vowed to continue reinventing the wheel. Drika is son to urban grooves pioneer Tinos “Slice T” Viriri of the boy band Slice International. After learning the ropes from his father, Drika said he was now determined to make an impact in foreign lands where music business is professionally done. “I am determined to make an impact here in South Africa after being embraced well in West Africa,” he said. “I love Afro beats and I can call myself an Afro pop musician because of my style. “I’m glad that I have managed to settle in South Africa where life is not easy for foreigners. I have made the right decision by settling here because I am living my dream.” Drika said he was elated after establishing himself in South Africa. “I am doing serious business here in South African where I am working on a collaboration with Malumnator of the LiyoShona fame,” he said. “My focus at the moment is to put myself and Zimbabwe on the world map and I believe, I am the next big star out of Zimbabwe to conquer the world soon.” Drika’s rich catalogue boasts of such club bangers as “Remember Me”, “Something” featuring Poptain and “Makomborero”. “Remember Me” which rocked West African countries, remains his huge hit. However, it is the Amapiano collabo with Maluminator that is set to catapult him to acclaim. Besides Poptain, the youngster has also worked with T Gonzi and Soul Jah Love impersonator, Lukko, born Tinashe Sandram. He is also working on new videos to complement his audios.

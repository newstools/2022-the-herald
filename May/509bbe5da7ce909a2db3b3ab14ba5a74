The Herald LONDON — Newspapers in Italy have paid their respects to Mino Raiola, after the football super-agent passed away due to an unspecified illness on Saturday at the age of 54. His death was met with an outpouring of emotion as several of his clients, including Erling Haaland, Marco Verratti and Hirving Lozano, posted personal tributes on social media shortly after the news was confirmed by Raiola’s family. The Italian media followed suit, with Raiola’s death dominating the headlines on the sports pages across the country. Corriere dello Sport led the way with the headline: ‘’Goodbye to the King of the Market’’. Raiola represented some of the biggest names in football during his career such as Paul Pogba, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Gianluigi Donnarumma and Mario Balotelli. He was well-known for his negotiating skills, which in turn meant that he played a significant role in a number of major transfers. It had appeared that he was set for another busy summer this year, with Pogba out of contract at Manchester United, while Haaland is believed to be closing in on a lucrative move to Manchester City. Meanwhile, La Gazzetta dello Sport simply went with ‘’Goodbye Raiola’’. They proceeded to label him ‘’the agent of the big stars’’, before reflecting on ‘’his infinite negotiations (and tugs of war)’’. Tuttosport added: ‘’Goodbye to Mino stuns football’’, in a reference to his popularity with players in the sport. — Mailonline.

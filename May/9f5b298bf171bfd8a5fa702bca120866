The Herald JOHANNESBURG. – After news of his sudden death sent shockwaves across the entertainment industry on Tuesday, Jamie Bartlett’s partner Rosa Onious has revealed his cause of death. “We got the autopsy results, and they said it was cardiac arrest,” she said. Bartlett died in his sleep on Monday evening. The emotional Onious said he had taken an afternoon nap, as he usually did when he was not working. She said she tried to wake him up at around 5pm so he could leave to meet up with his boys, but he did not wake up. “I said Jamie, Jamie, [but] Jamie didn’t look up,” she said. Onious said she tried once again to nudge him to wake him up. “Jamie’s not waking up, he’s not waking up, and I called my mom, who was outside, and she tried everything,” she said holding back tears. The mother and daughter then contacted an ambulance service that reportedly arrived within 15 minutes. “They tried everything to resuscitate him, CPR, everything, but it was too late,” she said. According to a November 2020 article by YOU, the couple met on a night out in Melville 11 years ago, but the sparks only began to fly when they reconnected in November 2019. Since news of his death broke, industry colleagues have flooded social media platforms with tributes and recollections of their relationships with the actor. Popularly known as “The Don” for his role as David Genaro on soapie “Rhythm City”, the actor was lauded for his ability to evoke a sense of fear in viewers with his husky voice and deathly stare. He left the show after more than a decade in the role, making his last appearance in February 2020. He was also much loved for his portrayal of the shady Mike O’Reilly on SABC3’s Isidingo. – News24.com

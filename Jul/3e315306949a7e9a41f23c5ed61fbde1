The Herald LONDON. — Paul Pogba has suffered a knee injury just 14 days after signing for Juventus and looks set to miss two months of action. The Frenchman quit Manchester United to return to Italy on a free transfer this summer after his contract at Old Trafford expired. Pogba (29) suffered a calf injury in the Red Devils’ 4-0 defeat to Liverpool in April — only making his return as Juve played Chivas Guadalajara on Saturday. He subsequently limped off during a training session, however, prompting Juve to conduct medical checks. The Old Lady have now confirmed that Pogba has suffered a “lesion of the lateral meniscus” — with Gazzetta dello Sport claiming the 2018 World Cup winner will need surgery and is set to miss two months. Juventus have released a statement over their marquee signing this summer so far. “Following the pain reported in his right knee, Paul Pogba was subjected to radiological investigations which revealed a lesion of the lateral meniscus,” the club reported. “In the next few hours he will undergo a specialist orthopedic consultation. Therefore, he will not take part in the trip to Dallas to continue treatment.” Last season, Pogba endured a difficult campaign fraught with injuries, which continued throughout the season. It saw him make just 20 appearances in the Premier League, as United finished in sixth place and failed to qualify for the Champions League. Massimiliano Allegri’s side have travelled to Dallas without the former £89 million man and is already eyeing up a new midfielder. Juventus are trying to flog two players to make space for PSG star Leandro Paredes. According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, they are hoping to flog Aaron Ramsey and Arthur — a transfer target for Arsenal. Ramsey (31) spent the second half of last season on loan at Rangers. He will be desperate for regular playing time ahead of Wales’ trip to the World Cup in Qatar this winter. — The Sun

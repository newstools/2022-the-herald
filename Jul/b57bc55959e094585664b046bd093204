The Herald LONDON. — The English Premier League footballer arrested in north London on suspicion of rape is now facing two more allegations of rape against a different woman dating back to last year. In the early hours of Monday morning, the player — who cannot be named for legal reasons — was taken into police custody and questioned over an alleged attack which took place last month. A statement from Metropolitan Police read: “On 4 July, an allegation of rape of a woman in her 20s was reported to police. It was reported the alleged rape happened in June 2022. “On 4 July, a 29-year-old man was arrested at an address in Barnet on suspicion of rape and taken into custody where he remains. Enquiries into the circumstances are ongoing.’’ A second statement on Tuesday confirmed the player in question had now been further arrested: “While in custody, he was further arrested on suspicion of two incidents of rape that were alleged to have been committed in April and June of 2021 against a different woman in her 20s. “He has subsequently been released on bail to a date in August. Enquiries into the circumstances are ongoing.’’ The player in question is believed to have already begun pre-season training ahead of the 2022/23 campaign and was due to take part in this year’s World Cup in Qatar, which kicks off in November. He was arrested while he was asleep at his home in Barnet at roughly 3am in the morning, with the first allegation relating to an attack that took place in Marbella last month. According to The Telegraph, the player’s club are aware of his arrest but have so far declined to comment. With the new English Premier League season due to kick off in a month’s time, teams are jetting off on their pre-season tours and it remains to be seen if the player in question will travel with the rest of the squad or face suspension while the investigation continues. — Metro

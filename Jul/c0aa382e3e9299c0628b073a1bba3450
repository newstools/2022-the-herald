During the operation, she said two laboratories processing gold-bearing materials were dismantled and that numerous mining equipment, implements, and a vehicle were seized for further investigation. In April this year, 10 Zimbabwean men were jailed for two years by a South African court after they were arrested for illegal mining activities in the Giyani area under Limpopo province. The gang was arrested by the neighbouring country’s elite police, the Hawks in May last year following a tip-off. They were found with an assortment of mining equipment worth R900 000 and R380 000 cash along the R81 near Giyani Shopping centre.

The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — SuperSport United coach Gavin Hunt has confirmed his new captain ahead of the 2022/23 South African Dstv Premiership football season, following the departure of Ronwen Williams to Mamelodi Sundowns. Williams was captain of SuperSport for two years after Dean Furman left the club in 2020. The goalkeeper’s departure has called for the club to appoint a new leader and 36-year-old Zimbabwean defender Onismor Bhasera has been handed the armband. “Bash (Bhasera) will be the captain this season. He has the experience, he is a great professional. He is a leader and I think he will take the role on. I think he will take this role well. It’s important for someone to come in and be verbal and keep standards as high as possible, which is not only on the field, but off the field. I am sure Bash will do well. He has my full support. I chose him. It was a democratic vote. It was me,” Hunt told the media at the DStv Premiership launch in Randburg, Johannesburg, on Thursday. Bhasera reacted to his appointment and spoke about how the loss of Williams is a big one for Matsatsantsa. Ricardo Goss joined SuperSport on a two-year loan deal as part of the Williams deal to Sundowns. “It (being captain) is a big responsibility. SuperSport is a big club, but I’ve got to take it with both hands and I will obviously have to go out there and lead by example. I need to bring my A-game, so it’s going to be an interesting season,” the experienced campaigner said. “Ronwen served the club well and it’s a big loss, but it’s a big opportunity for someone else who is going to come in and fill those shoes. He (Williams) is gone, but that’s football. Players are always moving around. We wish him luck at his new club.”— Laduma.

The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga-Sports Reporter ALL is set for the return of the annual Zimbabwe Open Table Tennis tournament to be held at Divaris Makaharis Group of Schools this weekend. The tournament is open to all the players and will have several categories, which include Under-10, Under-12, Under-19 and the Open, for both men and women. The Zimbabwe Table Tennis Union said they were excited to be hosting such a national event which returned to the calendar last year after a two-year break. The tournament will be held on Saturday and Sunday with several top players expected to take part. “We are expecting a huge turnout,” said ZTTU secretary-general, Tinashe Duri, who added that preparations are going on well as the technical director had a visit to the venue last week and has given them the greenlight to host the tournament. “After we recently attended International Table Tennis Federation competition management seminar in South Africa, we are well equipped to run such a big tournament. “We will be managing the whole event and sharing the knowledge we attained to others. “At the moment the association has received notifications from various athletes and corporates showing interest in taking part. “We are saying the door is open for everyone to come and have fun with us this weekend. “We are happy that the uniformed forces are joining us this time. ZRP teams and clubs are preparing to take part in the games which is a good thing for the sport. We are happy that new stakeholders are coming on board. We also want to thank Divaris Makaharis for the support with the venue,” said Duri.

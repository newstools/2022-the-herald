The Herald Senior Court Reporter An official of an obscure teachers’ union, Robson Chere, who is suspected to have teamed up with the union’s president Obert Masaraure to murder Roy Isa in Harare sometime in 2016, appeared at the Harare Magistrates Court yesterday. Chere and Masaraure are officials with the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ), whose membership remains unclear. Chere was not asked to plead to the charges when he appeared before magistrate Mrs Yeukai Dzuda, charged with murder. He was remanded in custody to July 28 and told only the High Court can grant bail for murder charges. It is said that on June 11, 2016 at around 10pm, Chere and Masaraure met Isa at the Quill Club in the Ambassador Hotel in Harare where they were drinking beer. At around 10:30pm, they both left the Quill Club and went to Cresta Jameson Hotel where Masaraure was booked in Room 712, on the seventh floor. They continued drinking at that hotel, according to the State. While they were drinking beer, a misunderstanding arose between Chere and Isa. Masaraure allegedly ended up ganging up with Chere against Isa and the two allegedly assaulted him on the head with unknown weapons along Jomo Kenyatta Street next to Jameson Hotel, resulting in his death. In a bid to conceal the offence, they then misrepresented that Isa jumped from the balcony of Masaraure’s room on the seventh floor. Isa’s body was taken for post-mortem and the pathologist concluded that the cause of death was brain damage, compound skull fracture and head trauma, according to the State.

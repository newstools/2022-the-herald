The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga-Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Chess Federation affiliates on Saturday gave a vote of no confidence to the federation’s president Collen Tongoona. Tongoona, who had been at the helm of the federation for three years after he was elected in 2019, could not finish his term of office as he was voted out by the disgruntled affiliates. The elections saw former vice-president Mucha Mkanganwi elevated to the top post and he said he would engage sponsors who had withdrawn from supporting the federation. Mkanganwi is a passionate chess player and is the founder and chairperson of the Chessmates Chess Academy, a model chess school situated in Mount Pleasant. Outside chess, Mkanganwi is a businessman and group chief executive officer of Pulse Pharmaceuticals, a leading wholesaler for pharmaceutical products in Zimbabwe which he founded in 2005. Mkanganwi is also a non-executive director of Stanbic Bank. Mkanganwi is expected to bring to the Zimbabwe Chess Federation varied business and corporate experience as well as a passion for excellence and development, attributes which will have a lasting positive impact on the growth of chess in Zimbabwe. “I am very humbled for the confidence you invested in me and I will work hard to make sure that the sport grows in leaps and bounds. It is my duty to make sure that we engage sponsors and make sure that there is trust between the federation and the corporate world. “There are many areas we are looking forward to improve and I take responsibility. I am hopeful that we will bring back the sponsors who had cut ties with us. “There is need for transparency and I will make sure that we achieve that and also to comply with the sports commission constitutions,” said Mkanganwi. ZCF is actively involved in developing chess from the grassroots level in all 10 provinces.

The Herald Tadious Manyepo Sports Reporter CASTLE Lager Premiership football club Ngezi Platinum Stars have fired coach Benjani Mwaruwari just four months into his three-year contract. The former Warriors skipper has been under increasing pressure after failing to put on convincing performances since his appointment in March. And his team’s 1-0 defeat to Yadah on Saturday worsened an already precarious situation he has been in with the management wielding the axe this morning. The club is expected to issue a statement later today. It was not immediately clear whether Mwaruwari has been chased away together with his entire backroom staff.

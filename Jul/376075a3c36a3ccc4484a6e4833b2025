The Herald LONDON. — Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly convinced Diego Simeone to bring him to Atletico Madrid. The Portuguese forward (37) is desperate to leave Manchester United this summer and play Champions League football. Ronaldo still has one year remaining on his Old Trafford contract but is yet to return for pre-season training with the Red Devils. However, the veteran has found that interest in him is not as high as he anticipated with a number of clubs ruling themselves out of the running to sign him. Both Chelsea and Bayern Munich have declared that they are not interested, while the star himself has zero interest in taking up a lucrative offer from an unnamed Saudi Arabian club. However, Spanish outlet Diario AS are now claiming that Ronaldo could be about to return to Spain with Atletico Madrid. He shot to superstardom with their rivals Real Madrid, scoring 311 goals in 292 La Liga matches between 2009 and 2018 and won the Champions League four times. And that made him public enemy No. 1 with their neighbours Atletico — but now he could be about to sensationally join them. The report states that his representatives have spoken with Atletico boss Simeone and persuaded him to make a move to get Ronaldo back to Madrid. Reports have also suggested that Sporting Lisbon would look to bring the player back to the club. Ronaldo’s mother Dolores Aveiro is a fan and vowed to speak to her son about a potential move back to his childhood club a year ago. However, Sporting director Hugo Viana poured cold water on the speculation recently suggesting that a move is unlikely to happen. — The Sun

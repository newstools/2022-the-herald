The Herald LONDON. — English broadcaster, journalist, writer, and television personality, Piers Morgan, believes that Cristiano Ronaldo is “highly unlikely” to play for Manchester United again. The brilliant Sun columnist believes that his old pal Cristiano has “mentally moved on” from Old Trafford and could end up somewhere “surprising”. Ronaldo (37) hasn’t attended Manchester United’s pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia for “family reasons” and is seeking a move away from the Theatre of Dreams. Boss Erik ten Hag has maintained that Ronaldo is in his plans for the coming season. But having spoken to his friend in the last seven days Piers believes a resolution is highly unlikely. Appearing on talkSPORT, the Talk TV host said: “I have had quite a lot of contact in the last week. I certainly think it’d be highly unlikely if Cristiano Ronaldo plays another game for Manchester United. “I just think mentally he’s moved on. “I’m not going to say what we’ve said to each other but like I said from the start I don’t think Cristiano feels Manchester United share his ambitions. “I think he feels that the signings they’re making, the commitment they showed last season, where they finished up and a lack of Champions League football . . . “If you’re him and coming towards the end of your career and you still want to win major trophies you’ve got to make a calculation. Am I going to do it if I stay at United? — The Sun

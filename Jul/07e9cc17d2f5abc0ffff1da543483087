FORMER Zimbabwe youth international footballer Walter “Ringers’’ Musanhu is aiming to hit a new high when he takes his China-based Jadel Academy Under-10 team to an elite 16-day tournament that will feature more than 500 teams  beginning on July 24. The 8-A-side contest will be held at the Thaiwoo Skiing Resort in Zhangjiakou Hebei Province and will run until August 9. Musanhu has emerged as one of the game-changers in junior development in the Asian country where he has nurtured several players some of whom are now being sought-after by elite teams across the world. And he has another chance of strengthening his CV when he takes 14 players, including one Zimbabwean Gary Kashitigu, to this annual jamboree. When contacted by The Herald yesterday, Musanhu said he has been preparing for this tournament since the start of the year and expressed confidence his team will do well. “Yeah, we started a few months ago and we’re already preparing to travel for a summer camp tournament that will run from July 24-August 9. “This is an Under-10 contest and we will be travelling to Hebei Province Zhangjiakou, Thaiwoo Skiing Resort,” he said. “We have selected 14 kids to participate at the summer camp 8-aside tournament Under-10, with almost 500 teams joining this tournament. “How I envy to see us involving ourselves in development initiatives like this back home (in Zimbabwe). “I’ll travel with players who are highly talented like David Liu, Emma Hu, Elsa and a Zimbabwean Gary Kashitiku.’’ Musanhu said after the tournament, he will fly back home to Zimbabwe with two age-group teams as he intends to organise a cultural exchange tournament here. “I’m also trying to organise cultural exchange programme tournament and bring two age-groups to Africa, Zimbabwe in particular. “We hope to travel for our tour to Zimbabwe soon, after traveling restrictions are flexible.”

The re-assignment has been part of the Zimbabwe Republic Police’s Human Resource Policy of enhancing performance in the organisation, ensure versatility among the senior officers, tapping into the senior officers’ experience as well as expertise, job rotation and the need to meet new policing demands as the country gears for Vision 2030. In January this year, the ZRP top brass was also reshuffled. Deputy Commissioner-General Stephen Mutamba was reassigned from operations to administration, while Deputy Comm-Gen Mind Elliot Ngirandi was moved from crime to human resources. Deputy Comm-Gen Learn Ncube was transferred to operations from administration, while Deputy Comm-Gen Lorraine Chipato was moved to crime from human resources. <img class="size-full wp-image-632271" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-28-at-2.08.32-PM.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-28-at-2.08.32-PM.jpeg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-28-at-2.08.32-PM-360x200.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Commissioner Patson Nyabadza The ZRP recently underwent a major transformation in 2018 as it adopted a new structure to win back public confidence. In 2019, the Police Service Commission (PSC) then approved a new structure that abolished the rank of senior assistant commissioner and replaced it with that of Commissioner of Police. The new rank of Commissioner of Police is different from the rank of commissioner that existed in the previous structure. The ZRP rank hierarchy under the new structure starts from constable to sergeant, sergeant-major, assistant inspector, inspector, chief inspector, superintendent, chief superintendent, assistant commissioner, Commissioner of Police, Deputy Commissioner-General and then Commissioner-General.

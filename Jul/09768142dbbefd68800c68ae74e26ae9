The Herald LONDON. — Robert Lewandowski’s move from Bayern Munich to Barcelona has seen Julian Nagelsmann hit out and question the Catalan side’s financial situation. Despite it being well known that Barcelona are in a dire financial state, they continue to be linked with multiple stars, and they’ve now splashed £90 million on Raphinha and Lewandowski. They’ve also signed Franck Kessié and Andreas Christensen on free transfers, and it’s fair to say that fans are confused at how they are pulling it off. But it seems as though even people within the industry are confused, as the Bayern boss questioned how they continue to get away with it. And it’s fair to say he’s rather sour about Lewandowsi’s exit. “Barcelona, the only club that has no money but then . . . buys every player they want,” Nagelsmann said to BILD. “I do not know how (they do it). It‘s kind of weird, kind of crazy.” Their mass summer business is in addition to the contract extension of Ousmane Dembele, and also the signings of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Ferran Torres in January. To put it simply, Barcelona have potentially disrupted future earnings to secure some quick funds now, as they sold 10 percent of their La Liga TV rights to US investment firm Sixth Street for 25 years. Gerard Pique, Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets have also taken pay-cuts, while Philippe Coutinho, Clement Lenglet and Antoine Griezmann have been offloaded to reduce their wage bill. The Catalan side are playing a risky game, and no one really knows how it’s going to pan out in the future, but for now they have Lewandowski much to the disgust of Bayern. — The Daily Star

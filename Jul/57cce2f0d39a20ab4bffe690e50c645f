The Herald LONDON. – Russian politicians lined up to celebrate the downfall of Boris Johnson yesterday, casting the British leader as a “stupid clown” who had finally got his just reward for arming Ukraine against Russia. The Kremlin said it didn’t like Johnson either. “He doesn’t like us, we don’t like him either,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said shortly before Johnson stood in Downing Street to announce his resignation. In his speech announcing he was stepping down, Johnson addressed the people of Ukraine, pledging that Britain would “continue to back your fight for freedom for as long as it takes”. Russians were brutal in their assessment of Johnson, who just recently was telling colleagues that he wanted to stay in power longer than Margaret Thatcher – a steady foe of the former Soviet Union who served as British prime minister from 1979 to 1990. Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska said on Telegram that it was an “inglorious end” for a “stupid clown” whose conscience would be blighted by “tens of thousands of lives in this senseless conflict in Ukraine”. “The clown is going,” said Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of Russia’s lower house of parliament. “He is one of the main ideologues of the war against Russia until the last Ukrainian. European leaders should think about where such a policy leads.” Maria Zakharova, the top spokeswoman in Russia’s foreign ministry, said Johnson’s fall was a symptom of the decline of the West, which she said was riven by political, ideological and economic crisis. “The moral of the story is: do not seek to destroy Russia,” Zakharova said. “Russia cannot be destroyed. You can break your teeth on it – and then choke on them.” Russia repeatedly dismissed him as a poorly prepared jester trying to punch far beyond Britain’s true weight. Zakharova gleefully portrayed Johnson as the author of his own downfall. “Boris Johnson was hit by a boomerang launched by himself,” she said. – Reuters

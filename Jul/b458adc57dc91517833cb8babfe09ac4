The Herald BIRMINGHAM – Commonwealth Games chiefs have confirmed esports is likely to join their full medal programme in 2026. Competitive gaming is appearing at the Games in Birmingham as a demonstration sport, with the Commonwealth Esports Championships taking place at the International Convention Centre next weekend. But it is now fully expected that esports will be included on the main schedule for Victoria 2026. ‘’If we weren’t going to be doing it, if we weren’t thinking of moving on, we wouldn’t be doing this (the pilot),’’ admitted Commonwealth Games Federation president Dame Louise Martin. ‘’We would never have given them permission to try and showcase this right in the middle of our Games.’’ CGF chief executive Katie Sadleir added: ‘’The Commonwealth Esports Championships that we are piloting is an example of how we are an organisation that wants to embrace the youth of the Commonwealth. ‘’We signed a long-term commitment with the Global Esports Federation and there are some really good wins for us in terms of working closely with them. ‘’The pilot is a pilot, we will evaluate it, but regardless we will have a close association with esports going forward. We like the fact we are doing it first. The phenomenon of esports is growing.’’ The International Olympic Committee are sending observers to the esports event in Birmingham with an eye on including it in future Olympic Games. ‑ Mailonline

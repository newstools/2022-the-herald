It is alleged that on May 4, Mangoma and his accomplices who are still at large, approached Chirikita’s place of residence driving an unmarked black Toyota Wish vehicle and parked at her gate. When Chirikita went to the gate in establish what was going on, it is alleged that two of Mangoma’s female accomplices told her that she was under arrest for an assault incident that happened in Hwedza. The female accomplices then allegedly dragged Chirikita into the car. It is the State’s case that the vehicle was then driven towards a local service station and then took Chirikita into a silver Ford Ranger that was parked at the intersection of Mharapara and Seke roads. Court papers further state that the Mangoma and his accomplices then proceeded towards Dema Growth Point, with the car being driven by someone who was putting on a Zimbabwe Republic Police uniform. It is further alleged that they then parked at a secluded bushy area and started assaulting the Chirikita with sticks on the feet and on her back several times, saying she should leave Washington Mugodhi’s faction and join theirs.

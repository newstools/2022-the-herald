The Herald Court Correspondent A TRUCK driver with Trolton Motors in Harare appeared in court yesterday facing allegations of stealing property left in his trust by his employer worth US$2 600. Nomore Marongwe (27) was remanded out of custody to August 3 on $15 000 bail for trial. Prosecutor Ms Chiedza Chikoore alleged that Marongwe used to transport goods outside Zimbabwe. He then allegedly sold a trampoline used to cover the goods, and a Samsung J7 cell phone that were being used for business purposes. Marongwe also allegedly stole some fertilisers in transit worth US$400. This came to light when the truck was on a weighbridge where it recorded that it had goods valued at US$900 but when it was initially weighed, it had good valued at US$1 300. Further allegations are on March 22, Marongwe went on to collect some cash amounting to US$1 050 from a client which was paid for a delivery he had made in Beira, Mozambique. It is alleged that he converted the money to own use, instead of handing it over to the employer, Mr Nwadike Chima of Trolton Motors. Nwadike made efforts to recover the money from the client who then said it had allegedly been given to Marongwe. Mr Chima then contacted Marongwe seeking to recover the money, to no avail since he had obtained a new job elsewhere. The total value stolen is US$2 600 and nothing was recovered.

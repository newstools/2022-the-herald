The Herald SYDNEY. — Aussie cricket fans have been left fuming after the bombshell announcement yesterday that South Africa has withdrawn from a scheduled ODI series in January next year. The Proteas have pulled out of the three ODIs, scheduled for Hobart, Sydney and Perth, due to a new Twenty20 league in South Africa. While the Proteas will still take part in the scheduled Test series, Cricket South Africa’s leaders last month told Cricket Australia they would not allow their players to stay Down Under for the white-ball series in fear of compromising the launch of their own domestic T20 league. CA tried to find alternative dates for the matches but were unable to do so, with a cramped schedule in 2023 involving a tour of India, an Ashes series and an ODI World Cup. “It is disappointing that Cricket South Africa will be unable to contest the ODI series in January,” CA chief executive Nick Hockley said. “That said, we are delighted to be hosting South Africa for the three-Test series which includes the Boxing Day and New Year’s Tests. “We can’t wait to see fans back at the cricket this summer.” South Africa’s staggering decision means they will forfeit all ICC Super League points to Australia, which may impact their ability to secure direct qualification for the 2023 World Cup. The Proteas are currently languishing in 11th spot with 49 points. Only the top eight teams from the 12 full member nations of the ICC, plus the Netherlands, will qualify for the World Cup. The other five teams will battle for the remaining two spots in play-off matches against five Associate sides. Due to the ODI series being called off, CA have relocated two men’s T20Is to the Gabba and Optus Stadium in Perth, as well as a women’s international to Hobart’s Blundstone Arena. — AFP

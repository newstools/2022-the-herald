The Herald KINSHASA. — The remains of Democratic Republic of Congo’s independence hero and first Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba were laid to rest in Kinshasa yesterday amid honours including a procession through the capital, military salutes and music in front of thousands of people. President Felix Tshisekedi saluted Lumumba, calling him a humanist who made the ultimate sacrifice for his country. “Today, the Congolese people are able to understand how and why he fought the oppression of the time without fear or trembling,” said Tshisikedi. Lumumba was interred in a Chinese-built mausoleum topped by a towering statue in a central square in Kinshasa. The ceremony was attended by diplomats and dignitaries including President Denis Sassou N’guesso of the neighbouring Republic of Congo who mingled in the courtyard in front of the mausoleum. Lumumba was buried with a military salute and then his family was given time alone with him. The ceremony was held on DRC’s Independence Day, marking when the country became independent from Belgium in 1960. Lumumba is widely hailed as the nationalist activist who helped to end colonial rule. He became the country’s first prime minister and was assassinated within a year in 1961. – AP.

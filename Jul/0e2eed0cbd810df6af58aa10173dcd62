The Herald Chido Nyamuyaruka-Court Correspondent TWO men appeared at the Harare Magistrates Court on allegations of duping a home seeker of US$4 500 and $14 000 when they sold him a non-existing stand. Nhete Chinzote (52) and Israel Muchemwa (57) appeared before magistrate Mrs Yeukai Dzuda charged with fraud. They were not asked to plead and were remanded in custody to September 15. It is the State’s case that in October 2018, the two allegedly lied to the complainant that they were selling residential stands in Warren Park, Borrowdale, Waterfalls, Mabvuku and Norton. The complainant opted for a 500 square metre residential stand in Cleverhill, Borrowdale, in Harare which was being sold for US$9 000. It is said the complainant then paid US$4 500 for the purchase of the residential stand into a given ZB Bank account and he was issued with a receipt. Chinzote allegedly accompanied the complainant to Cleverhill where he claimed the stand was said to be, adding that the piece of land would be developed later. In July 2020, the complainant transferred another $13 968 from his account, making a full payment towards the residential stand. He was later surprised to be shown an undeveloped piece of land when they returned to Cleverhill. It was then that the complainant discovered Muchemwa and Chinzote were using a forged cooperative certificate where Israel Muchemwa was the chairman, prompting him to lodge a complaint with the police. This led to their arrest.

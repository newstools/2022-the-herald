The Herald FLORIDA. — Robert Lewandowski has joined up with his new Barcelona team-mates in Florida after completing a £42.5 million move from Bayern Munich. The prolific Polish striker posed on a lifeguard station on the beach in the Sunshine State before embracing his new colleagues and club president Joan Laporta. The 33-year-old, who scored a remarkable 344 goals in 375 matches for Bayern, vowed to return the glory days to the Nou Camp by scoring bucketfuls of goals in Spain. ‘’Finally I am here and I am very happy to join Barcelona. The last few days were very long days but in the end the deal was done so now I am going to focus on a new chapter in my life and a new challenge,’’ said Lewandowski. ‘’But I am still the guy who wants to win, not only the game but also the titles so I hope from the beginning of the season we will begin winning and go for the titles during the season and at the end of the season. ‘’I always wanted to play in LaLiga, I always wanted to play for the biggest clubs. It is the next step. Also for my private life, it was a new challenge. ‘’I know that it’s time to get Barcelona back on track and I am here to help them get back to the top and to winning as many titles as possible. — Mailonline

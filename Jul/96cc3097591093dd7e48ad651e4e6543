The Herald MASVINGO. – Police in Masvingo City recently arrested three security guards from Etland Milling Company for allegedly fatally assaulting a man who had broken into a warehouse at their workplace on Tuesday around midnight. Regus Togarepi (24) of Mabheire village under chief Makore, Gutu, Joseph Magombeyi (20) of Chidawanyika village, Watsomba in Mutasa and Mathias Murombo (33) of Murombo village in Makore, Gutu, are employed by Etland Milling Company. The deceased, Takunda Maindidze (18) allegedly approached the company’s premises and broke into a warehouse that had maize and maize meal bags while Murombo was observing him from a distance. Murombo allegedly called his two workmates, Togarepi, who is said to be son to Gutu South legislator and Zanu PF National Assembly chief whip
Pupurai, and Magombeyi by phone. The trio confronted Maindidze and, while accusing him of being a thief, started assaulting him all over the body using belts until he became unconscious and collapsed. The three dragged Maindidze for about 400 metres from the scene into the neighboring Cold Storage Commission premises, towards Mucheke River, and dumped his body one and half metres from the Mudhefudhefu Footbridge, which leads into Mucheke A from the industrial area. A passer-by noticed the lifeless body at around 6:30am and made a report to the police, who attended the scene. During investigations, it emerged that Togarepi and Magombeyi had been seen cleaning blood stains on the verandah of their workplace. The police proceeded to Etland Milling Company and found Togarepi and Magombeyi still cleaning the blood and, upon being interviewed, the two
implicated Murombo. Provincial police spokesperson Inspector Kudakwashe Dhewa warned the public against taking the law into their own hands when they
apprehend suspects. – New Ziana

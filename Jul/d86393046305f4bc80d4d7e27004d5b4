The Herald Chenai Museta Herald Reporter The Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) last week nabbed Samuel Moses (56) of Seke for duping citizens while masquerading as its recruitment agent. Moses, who is a teacher at Chikonde Secondary School, was arrested after conning siblings Brighton and Charity Madzinga of US$260 after promising to facilitate their recruitment into the ZNA. In a statement, ZNA director Public Relations, Colonel Alphios Makotore said thearmy has on several occasions warned members of the public to be on the lookout for fraudsters prowling the streets purporting to be ZNA recruitment agents. “On many occasions, the ZNA reiterates that it does not have recruiting agents nor does it use social media for recruitment. All Army recruitment adverts, notices and news releases are published in the main stream media,” he said. “The ZNA continues to urge members of the public that they must report to the nearest Zimbabwe Military Police or the nearest ZRP station should they come across any suspicious characters claiming to be ZNA recruitment agents.” He said Moses was arrested in Harare for impersonation following a tip off by members of the public and upon arrest, he was handed to the police for further investigations. Col Makotore said initial investigations have revealed that sometime in March 2022, Moses purporting to be a ZNA recruiting officer allegedly met Charity and promised to assist her in joining the army on condition that she paid him US$130 as a facilitation fee.

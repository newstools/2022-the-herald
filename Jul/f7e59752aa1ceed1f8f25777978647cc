The Herald Senior Court Reporter HARARE regional magistrate Mrs Learnmore Mapiye has had to delay her decision on whether Marry Mubaiwa will be put to her defence to explain herself on charges of assaulting her former maid sometime in 2020 since the State has yet to respond to Mubaiwa’s application for discharge. Mrs Mapiye was expected to make the ruling yesterday after the State led by Mrs Netsai Mushayabasa closed its case a fortnight ago after leading all its witnesses. Yesterday, the State filed its submissions and now Mubaiwa, through her lawyer Ms Beatrice Mtetwa, needs to respond before the court makes a ruling on December 10. The State alleges that on January 28, 2020 at around midday, Mubaiwa hit her maid outside her son’s school.

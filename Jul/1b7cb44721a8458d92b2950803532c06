The Herald Marian Nyasha Kwari Herbalist Indigestion Friends, welcome to this week’s herbal space. For the majority of my patients, it has been a week of arduous work and an endeavour to get us eating well and eliminate indigestion. Indigestion, the most widespread illness in the world, is a catch-all phrase encompassing a variety of discomforts, including heartburn, gas, bloating, burping, colic, nausea, and vomiting. Unhealthy eating is the root cause of this agonising illness. This includes overeating, eating fatty meals, eating too much, eating while drinking alcohol, eating too rapidly, not chewing food thoroughly, eating while chatting, eating under extreme stress, and eating when feeling anxious or stressed. We need to raise our awareness of potentially harmful foods including sausages, processed meats, fast foods, crisps, and other highly flavoured snacks. In spite of the fact that we are harming our children’s digestive systems from a young age, mothers have a propensity to pack polony and crisps, or “mazepe,” as they are commonly known. Watch out for tartrate and other colourants, flavouring, stabilising, anti-caking, preservative, and other chemicals that are added to processed and long-lasting foods. Steer clear of fizzy beverages and dishes high in creamy sauces and sugar. Which path should we take? Our dietary habits require a significant shift. These fruits are easy to digest while you are constipated? Fruits can be consumed in a variety of ways, including as plain, in salads, smoothies, and juices. A cup of hot water with a thin slice or two of fresh ginger and some fresh mint is a natural anti-acidic digestive. Keep in mind GRAVIOLA, a tea that helps tone the body and boosts the immune system. Look after yourself and each other. God Bless. Get in touch with Miriam Kwari on 0773378571

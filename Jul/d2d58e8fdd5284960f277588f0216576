The Herald LONDON. — As Ian Poulter claimed he does not expect a hostile reception in the Scottish Open locker room, American Billy Horschel launched a scathing attack on LIV Golf’s rebel players, calling them “hypocrites and liars”. Poulter is eligible for this week’s co-sanctioned event at the Renaissance Club in East Lothian after winning the first stage of a legal battle against the DP World Tour. The Wentworth-based circuit had banned the Englishman along with 15 other LIV players from the Genesis Scottish Open after they took part in last month’s opening event on the Saudi-funded series. “They decided to go play on that tour and they should go play there. They shouldn’t be coming back over to the DP World Tour or the PGA Tour,” Horschel, the reigning BMW PGA champion, stated before the Scottish Open. “To say that they wanted to also support the DP World or PGA Tour going forward, while playing the LIV Tour, is completely asinine in my opinion. “It’s unfortunate that those guys made their bed and that’s what they want to do. Leave us alone, honestly. “Last week’s events, I’ve been really frustrated by because there are a lot of guys that are hypocrites that are not telling the truth and lying about some things. — BBC Sport

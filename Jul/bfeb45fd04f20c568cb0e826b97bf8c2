The Herald Senior Court Reporter A lawyer representing one of the two employees of Mashwede Holdings convicted of stealing fuel coupons worth nearly US$17 000, told the court on Tuesday that he wants to make an application to refer his client to the Constitutional Court before sentence is passed to see if his client was properly before the court. Mr Gift Nyandoro realised late on Monday afternoon after the conviction that his client, Ernest Nevanji Madanhire, had no CRB number, the number used to identify the case. Madanhire, who was an ICT officer, was convicted together with Edson Mashamhanda, a former bookkeeper at Mashwede Holdings, on fraud charges by Harare magistrate Mrs Evelyn Mashavirakure after a full trial. Yesterday, Mr Nyandoro applied that the sentencing be postponed to Friday to allow him to mount an application for referral of the matter to the Constitutional Court. The State led by Mr Moses Mapanga consented to the postponement.

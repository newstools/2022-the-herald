The Herald LONDON. — Zimbabwe-born British boxer Derek Chisora admitted his boxing career is coming to a close and he wants to go out with a bang. The heavyweight veteran made the admission after he overcame Kubrat Pulev in their epic rematch on Saturday night. Chisora (38) had not won in his last three bouts, having last celebrated victory in 2019. And while he lives to fight another day there will not be too many more — leaving Deontay Wilder at the top of his wish-list Chisora said: “I last won a fight three years ago . . . “I’m happy today but at the same time I’m sad. I don’t have many left in me but what I do have I will give my all to you guys. “I don’t have many left, so my next couple of fights . . . I’m on my way out. “I don’t have many left in me but what I do have I will give my all to you guys. “I don’t have many left, so my next couple of fights . . . I’m on my way out. “I don’t want no easy fights, I want the hard fights. I told Eddie Hearn the other day, if he can get me the Bronze Bomber I’ll be happy. “I want to fight everybody in my era. Win or lose, I just want to fight.” The Londoner fumed after leaving Germany with a split-decision loss to Pulev (41) in 2016 but it was the Bulgarain’s turn to lose in the away corner. — The Sun

Musoni saluted President Kagame for leading the Rwanda Patriotic Front in ending the Genocide against the Tutsi saying: “For three long months in 1994, our country’s survival was in doubt. One of the worst tragedies unfolded. A segment of the population was being hunted and killed. More than a million people were murdered.  By July 4th, the Forces of the Rwandan Patriotic Army led by President Kagame had brought the killings to an end and we salute these Heroes whose sacrifice, patriotism, resilience and selflessness made it happen.”  Musoni said when Rwanda gained its independence on 1st of July in 1962, regimes that took power up to 1994 perpetuated the segregation legacy of the colonial masters which included propagating sectarianism, promoting hatred among Rwandans; masterminded the exclusion and oppression of some Rwandans, especially Tutsis in schools, work and politics, killing them and forcing them into exile.  He said Rwanda is stable, unified and recording socio-economic developments.  He said Rwanda was ranked the 2nd to ease doing business on the continent with potential investors requiring only six hours to register a business. <img class="size-full wp-image-627287 aligncenter" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-05-at-1.34.18-PM-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-05-at-1.34.18-PM-1.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-05-at-1.34.18-PM-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “The ongoing massive infrastructure development in Rwanda has transformed the country into a regional hub of service industry and ease transport network,” Musoni said.  “Rwanda is currently ranked 3rd by the World Bank’s Global competitive report index in Africa for the best and quality roads. Kigali is currently topping the electrified cities in Africa with all the key streets having public lights.”  He said today close to 100 percent of Rwandans have access to health insurance as a result of policies put in place by the Government.

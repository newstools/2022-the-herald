Of particular interest are innovative products from the baobab tree with three of the exhibitors showcasing a variety of products from the baobab tree ranging from porridge, skin oils, juices, candy, powder for smoothies, baking powder, red fibre, and coffee. Other innovative products are in form of organic products including jam made from melon, ginger, guava among other organic products. Another firm, Afrostain Farmtech, a smart farming solutions enterprise is showcasing drone technology, remote sensing among other Geographic information systems solutions. Some of the exhibiting firms confirmed clinching deals to supply big retail outlets such as Pick n Pay in Zambia. Others are seriously considering setting up base in Zambia following the “overwhelming” response to their products. Sibusisiwe Chitewe, Product Development Executive at Bulawayo based Das Foods, which manufactures organic foods, said ZACS has been good and an eye opener for food processors as there is a lot of demand for Zimbabwean products which are known to be organic and not genetically modified. “We are excited because we have been getting a lot of enquiries for supplies, so after the Show we are going to be finalising with the distributors that we established contacts with during the show,” said Mrs Chitewe. Choice Rusike, founder and director of Jadesave Investments, which produces building materials and chemicals for the construction sector, expressed the same sentiments saying ZACS has been very positive and exciting. “We have had quite exciting enquiries, from large construction companies and hardwares and we are looking to have our products on their shelves.” Mrs Rusike said her firm is now seriously considering and will be doing due diligence with the aim of setting up a branch in Zambia before the end of the year. She expressed her gratitude to Zimtrade for the SheExporter programme which has enabled women led businesses to come and showcase at platforms such as ZACS. Zimtrade says the positive feedback on participating firms will be used to springboard more local products into the neighbouring country. In an earlier interview ZimTrade Chief Executive Officer, Allan Majuru, said the comments received by participating companies from potential buyers shows a positive outlook for Zimbabwean products in Zambia. “There is potential for diversified products in the Zambian market riding on the existing positive reputation of Zimbabwe’s quality products. “Already most buyers in the market are familiar with high quality of products from Zimbabwe and have indicated that they prefer our products compared to competition,” he said.

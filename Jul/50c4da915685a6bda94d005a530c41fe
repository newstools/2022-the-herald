The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga-Sports Reporter BLACK Rhinos midfielder Ashward Phiri said they are not deterred by drawing against CAPS United in the Chibuku Super Cup as they are aiming to progress to the next stage. Rhinos, who parted ways with their coach Herbert “Jompano’’ Maruwa yesterday, will battle it out with an equally struggling Makepekepe in the knock-out tournament. Phiri, a seasoned player who has seen duty with CAPS United back in 2014 where he did not get enough game time, managed to make his name for himself at the now-defunct Mushowani Stars before he joined the army side. “We are very comfortable as this is a knock-out tournament and as players we were expecting to face any side. People may take it as the main game after the draw considering our derby rivalry. “I am a former CAPS United player and I know the pressure which comes with playing for such a big club but it will be to our advantage. “We will be at home and that will give us an edge and the players are working had for both the Chibuku Super Cup and the league. We need to do well in both competitions and I believe everyone will have a point to prove,” said Phiri. The matches between the two sides are always interesting with the sides sharing the spoils in both legs of this season’s league meetings. The first match back in February ended in a 1-1 draw before they settled for a goalless stalemate on July 10 Rhinos was the seeded side in the draw as they were on eighth position after week 17 fixtures but CAPS United are not that consistent.

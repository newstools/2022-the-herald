The Herald Herald Correspondent Chengeto Mayowe, daughter to the late national hero, Ambassador John George Mayowe, yesterday launched the MambokadziBuilds Book Drive under her non-profit, MambokadziBuilds Foundation. This milestone saw the foundation donating books to Bradford College in Tafara, Harare. The foundation seeks to donate to one learning institution a month. “The aim is to donate as much Zimbabwean literature as we can across the nation so that children can read books written by Zimbabweans. I will be starting with my catalogue of books which include two poetry books and a fictional trilogy based on Zimbabwean myths, customs and traditions,” said Chengeto. The foundation hopes to work with local authors in the near future so as to include a variety of books. Chengeto would appear to be following in her father’s footsteps as she is very keen on playing her role in building the country brick by brick. The first official recipient of the book drive was a young girl named Tino who led Chengeto to her school, Bradford College in Tafara. This is where the first official donation by MambokadziBuilds was made yesterday. “Both his Excellency the President Mnangagwa and the First Lady, Dr Amai Auxillia Mnangagwa, have stated the need to build up our country. They have also shown unwavering support for the arts, crafts, literature and cultural heritage sector. “Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo so ndokuvaka kwatiri kuita with the MambokadziBuilds Book Drive, brick by brick,” she said. MambokadziBuilds is a non-profit organisation that seeks to empower women and children through arts, literature, crafts and cultural heritage. At the end of June it launched the book drive targeted at children from Grade 5 and above. The aim is to donate Zimbabwean literature to schools across Zimbabwe as well as families that struggle. This will help teach the children from a young age about our culture and traditions.

The Herald Fidelis Munyoro Chief Court Reporter HIGH Court judge Justice Webster Chinamora yesterday led the court in welcoming newly admitted legal practitioners during a ceremony in Harare. Goromonzi West legislator, Energy Mutodi, along with Panashe Moyo, Fungai Mabika, Mercy Chera, Senzeni Maposa and Farai Kwetirini, took their official oaths before Justice Chinamora sitting in the Motion Court. Before asking the court to welcome the new lawyers, Justice Chinamora congratulated them and stressed their professional role. “I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to you on this momentous day for you all,” he said. “Remember that you are now officers of this court and your first duty is to the court. Whenever you find instructions from your client conflicting with your ethical responsibilities, please decline the brief or walk away from it.” After graduating, lawyers have to work under supervision at first, but then are sworn in as officers of the High Court, taking the oath of loyalty to Zimbabwe and an oath of office, and can now practice law without a supervisor. Justice Chinamora also reminded Mr Mutodi that he was just a lawyer when in court: “I am sure you realise that you are ‘Honourable’ in your political constituency and not in this court.” Mr Mutodi was elated at being admitted as a lawyer. He said it was an interesting experience to enrol with the court and to be presented with an opportunity to serve the country through its judicial service while also participating in law making as a Member of Parliament. “The practice will allow me to serve Zimbabwe better in the tasks that I will handle especially when dealing with contemporary problems that the country is facing,” said Mr Mutodi.

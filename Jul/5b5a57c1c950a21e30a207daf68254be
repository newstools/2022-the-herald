Figures from ZIMRA show that the debt to revenue ratio increased from 4,76 percent as at December 2020 to 7,17 percent as at December 2021. ZIMRA income statement had a surplus of $723,3 million compared to $187,2 million in 2020. A surplus on revaluation amounting to $9,355 billion was realized due to revaluation of assets.

The Herald KINSHASA. – A few months ago, the pictures of Congolese musical group Wenge Musica’’ circulated on social media when some of its leaders gathered in a room to speak with one voice. JB Mpiana, Didier Masela, Werrason, Alain Makaba, Adolf Dominguez were part of the founding members of the musical band created in 1980. This group was very popular between 1986 and 1997 thanks to its Kino musical style which associated the Congolese rumba, sung in Lingala with unique dance steps that later became known as the Soukous and the Ndombolo in its evolution. It all started in the Bandalungwa commune, one of the 24 communes of Kinshasa. Young men with a passion for music got together and created the band- Wenge Musica. Wenge Musica was very active between 1981 and 1997 and was successful with the release of several albums. The group is best known for having helped popularize ‘ndombolo’, a dance derived from the Congolese rumba and soukouss. Despite its success and fame, the band broke up in 1997. Bickering between the two leaders, JB Mpiana and Werrason, led to the demise of the group. But success did not stop for some members of the band as some went on to live excellent solo careers.  After 25 years of quarrelling, the leaders of the group decided to break down the walls that separated them and pick up their common history where it left off. This reconciliation was sealed by a concert at the Stade des Martyrs in Kinshasa – africanews

The Herald NAIROBI. – The Kenyan government says it will arrest, prosecute and charge anyone found selling a 2kg packet of maize flour at more than 100 shillings ( 84 US cents). In a televised address on Thursday, President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered that the cost of the staple food be halved from 205 shillings. The government is still working out how it will compensate retailers who had purchased expensive stock before the price announcement was made, spokesman Cyrus Oguna tsaid Many have questioned how all vendors will be informed, how much they’ll be compensated, and how it will all be enforced. Some shop owners have not adopted the price changes for fear of losing income. Critics say Mr Kenyatta is using the measure to influence the choice of his successor in the 9 August elections. Mr Kenyatta has rejected the accusation and said the price rises themselves were political. “It is shocking to politicise the misery of the vulnerable…  it’s more distasteful to gain political capital out of the sufferings of the vulnerable, without offering solutions,” he said in a speech. His government has blamed external factors, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, for affecting the prices of fuel and food. – BBCWorld

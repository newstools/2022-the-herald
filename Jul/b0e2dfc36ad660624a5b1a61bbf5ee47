The Herald LONDON. — Cristiano Ronaldo could be set to stay at Manchester United with the Portugal international running out of options for a move away from Old Trafford this summer, after Chelsea recently distanced themselves from any potential deal. Ronaldo remains absent from United’s pre-season tour to Australia amid speculation of a transfer away from Old Trafford. United will be playing Europa League football during the forthcoming season  —  something Ronaldo has never done during his illustrious playing career — and the 37-year-old wants to leave United as he looks for Champions League football. Reports have suggested Ronaldo has a mega-money offer on the table from Saudi Arabia, but it is a deal that does not appeal to the superstar. Manchester United’s stance regarding Cristiano Ronaldo’s future has remained unchanged. The club are willing to listen to offers for Ronaldo this summer, Sky Sports News understands, but the club’s public stance remains that he is not for sale. Erik ten Hag said in Bangkok that Ronaldo, who has one year remaining on his United contract, is in his plans for the season ahead and expects him to stay at the club. “We are planning for Cristiano Ronaldo for the season and that’s it. I’m looking forward to working with him. Cristiano is not for sale. He is in our plans and we want success together. “He’s not with us and it’s due to personal issues. I spoke with him before this issue came up. I had a conversation with him and I had a good talk. That is between Cristiano and me. What I can confirm is we had a really good conversation together. I didn’t speak to him after (the news).” And on arrival in Melbourne, Ten Hag refused to make any further comment on Ronaldo’s future. “We made a statement and nothing has changed,” the Dutchman said ahead of yesterday’s friendly match against A-League outfit Melbourne Victory at the MCG. — Sky Sports.

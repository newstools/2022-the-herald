The Herald WASHINGTON. – United States President Joe Biden who tested positive for Covid-19 yesterday, was experiencing “very mild symptoms” and will continue to carry out his duties, the White House has said. Biden, 79, who will isolate at the White House, has been in contact with members of staff and will participate in planned meetings, the president’s press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre announced in a statement yesterday morning. The president has begun taking Paxlovid, an antiviral drug recommended for those at risk of severe illness. Biden’s Covid-19 diagnosis was confirmed by both antigen and PCR tests, the president’s physician, Dr Kevin O’Connor said. The president’s symptoms include a “runny nose”, “fatigue, with an occasional dry cough” which began on Wednesday evening, O’Connor wrote. The medic anticipated Biden “will respond favourably” to treatment. The White House said it will provide a daily update on Biden’s status, and will inform anyone who has been in close contact with the president. The president tweeted a photo yesterday saying “I’m doing great. Thanks for your concern.” He said he was “Keeping busy!” Biden will work in isolation until he tests negative, consistent with White House COVID-19 protocol, more stringent than guidance from the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. – Al Jazeera

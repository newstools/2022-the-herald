The Herald Court Reporter The bail appeal by CCC legislators, Job Sikhala and Godfrey Sithole, yesterday hit a snag at the High Court as the prosecution requested for more time to file their response. Sikhala, who is the party’s deputy national chairperson and Sithole, who is the Chitungwiza North legislator, are appealing against a magistrate’s decision not to grant them bail pending trial on charges of incitement to commit violence. Justice Munamato Mutevedzi deferred the matter to tomorrow at the request of the prosecution, who are today expected to file their response. Sikhala and Sithole are accused of mobilising their party supporters to unleash an orgy violence in the Nyatsime area of Chitungwiza, during a memorial service for Moreblessing Ali. The duo unsuccessfully applied for bail last week before Harare magistrate Mr Gibson Mandaza. In denying the duo bail, Mr Mandaza ruled that the legislators were a threat to public security and were likely to re-offend if released on bail. Ali, who the CCC said was their supporter, was abducted outside a nightclub in Nyatsime on May 14 and her dismembered remains were discovered in a disused well at a farm in Beatrice, about 10km away from where she was dragged. The prime suspect in her murder, Pius Jamba (31), has since been arrested and was remanded in custody. Jamba is understood to have been Ali’s boyfriend. Sikhala and Sithole were arrested on June 14 charged with conspiring to engage in acts of violence to avenge the killing.

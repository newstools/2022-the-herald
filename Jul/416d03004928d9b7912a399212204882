The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter PRIME Rangers Soccer Academy were crowned champions of the inaugural Prime Leisure Centre Under-21 Challenge Football League after beating Effenberg 1-0 in the final at Allan Wilson School over the weekend. After overcoming a tricky Group B phase which featured tournament favourites, Friendly Academy and an impressive DC Academy, Prime Rangers, under the guidance of former Premier League players Godfrey Moyo and Beavan Chikaka, defied all odds to be crowned champions. Speaking after the victory, head coach Moyo said such tournaments are important in developing future stars. “As a team we are happy with the win and our first trophy since we joined the Challenge Football League. These tournaments play a huge role in developing future football stars and we are really grateful to the sponsors for this opportunity they are giving to upcoming football stars. “We believe in player development and this win will go a long way in motivating our young players to keep working hard so that they can achieve their dreams of playing Premier League football,” he said. Prime Rangers goalkeeper, Blessed Chitsa, was the star of the show as he was crowned both Player of the Tournament and Goalkeeper of the Tournament after he helped to drive his team to the final. In the semi-finals against Cranborne he saved three penalties when the match had ended 0-0 in regulation time. Other teams which participated in the tournament included defending champions BN Academy, DC Academy, Sports Vale, Chitungwiza Academy and Cranborne. This year’s tournament was sponsored by Prime Leisure Centre through their Ruwa Foods Butchery, Prime Butchery Zengeza, Prime Night Club Ruwa and Prime Liquor Store Zengeza.

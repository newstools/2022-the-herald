The Herald Danai Chitakasha-Special Correspondent ANY student of literature can attest that we learn a lot about a character from what they say. Of course, what people say is not the alpha and omega of character analysis but, to a large extent, it helps us to understand them better. Judging by recent statements made by coaches Norman Mapeza and Tonderai Ndiraya, I think we can come up with an informed conclusion on who they and what they believe in with regards to the beautiful game of football. <img class="size-full wp-image-626667" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/Norman-Mapeza.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/Norman-Mapeza.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/Norman-Mapeza-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Norman Mapeza Their views are diametrically opposed and this therefore makes for an intriguing battle tomorrow when Dynamos meet with FC Platinum in a Castle Lager Premiership match at the National Sports Stadium. In one interview, FC Platinum coach Mapeza had this to say: “We are trying to play the game, sometimes we play with teams which cannot make two or three passes, it’s disappointing but we will keep trying to play well…!” His emphasis on passing was telling and his frustration with a non-passing style of play was evident from the interview. It is generally accepted in our football fraternity that Mapeza prefers the patient passing approach to the game and his teams try to implement this style. In another interview, Dynamos coach Ndiraya, on the back of another 1-0 victory, said: “People can criticise us for not passing a lot but what is the use of passing if you do not win the game… We are happy with the result!” From the above statement, it is obvious how the young coach approaches the game of football. For him the result is more important than the style. He fell short of saying passing is an unnecessary burden if one can get a result without it. In football we often ask, does the means justify the end or does the end justify the means? The two coaches are definitely holding two different ends of the stick. One prefers style and hopefully substance, the other is prepared to sacrifice style on the altar of results. For any keen follower of the game, it is an interesting situation. While this debate is taking root on the Zimbabwean football landscape, it is not new on the world stage. In recent times it has been Jose Mourinho versus Arsene Wenger and more recently versus Pep Guardiola. Since these managers have dominated the football discourse in the past 20 years or so, they now have disciples who defend their football philosophies passionately. I have friends I discuss football with and they belong to either the Mourinho or Guardiola camp. My friends Innocent Mupatsi, the one we know as “The Football Brain”, Justice Sadzauchi and Takura Masunga belong unapologetically to the Mourinho camp. They refer to him as the best manager since 2000 because he knows how to get a result. They have even coined a term for the Mourinho approach. They call it “Python Football!” Dear reader, what does a python do? It waits for its prey before pouncing and suffocating it to death. Such is the Mourinho approach to football and he has used it numerous times against football purists like Wenger and Guardiola.  He used to enjoy winning against Wenger, for example. I remember many times when Arsenal would play and play, Chelsea would wait and wait. Then boom, Didier Drogba plants a header, boom, another free-kick from him and Arsenal would depart empty-handed once more. It was very frustrating for Wenger and Arsenal fans who believed in the aesthetics of the game. The other group of my friends, which include Mudhara Genaro Mashayamombe, Taurai Malinganiso and Cad Abbito, belong to the Guardiola camp. They too have coined a term for this approach. They call it “The Zig Zag” approach. Remember the Zig Zag Band dear reader… Well, this is not about that band, this is about the dazzling approach to football which can leave teams dizzy from passing moves before a goal is scored. The Guardiola approach, just like Wenger before him, is the passing approach and on many occasions goals have been scored after a series of five passes and above. Team goals are the DNA of most Guardiola teams just like they were the DNA of Wenger teams. Many managers /coaches have evolved their own styles and as fans we enjoy it when one football style triumphs over another. It is, however, important to note that managers are not always slaves to their philosophies. Guardiola himself sometimes can play the long ball, especially since his goalkeepers tend to be good with their passing. And yes, sometimes Mourinho can play tiki taka as well though it’s a rare phenomenon! As we await the blockbuster match between fading giants Dynamos Dembare and resurgent FC Platinum (Platso), which football style will triumph? Will the two coaches be brave enough to stick with their philosophies? I know Norman will not change and I hope Tonde will not be pressured to change. I also know that if Dynamos win playing ugly, the fans will give Ndiraya some breathing space. Above all, it is good for our football to have such characters who are brave enough to execute their football ideas. We need more such personalities. All the best to them.

The Herald Senior Court Reporter HARARE City FC player Jerry Chipangura (24) yesterday appeared in court on allegations of possessing 40g of methylenedioxymethamphetamine — commonly known as mutoriro — worth $200 000 that he allegedly intended to sell in the city. The meth must have been smuggled into the country since it is an illegal drug, although not necessarily by those who hold or sell it. Chipangura was not asked to plead to the charges when he appeared before magistrate Mr Stanford Mambanje, who remanded him in custody to July 21. The State led by Mr Lancelot Mutsokoti opposed the granting of  bail, saying he was facing a serious offence which attracts a custodial sentence, which might induce him to flee. Mr Mutsokoti also told the court that the police were still tracking and yet to arrest the drug trafficker who smuggled the contraband into the country, raising fears that Chipangura might jeopardise investigations. On June 30 at around 8pm, police were informed that Chipangura was dealing in meth in Mabvuku, Harare. Detectives went to New Mabvuku where they found him along John Tapedza Road. Detectives identified themselves before searching him and found 40g of meth in a small Adidas black bag that he was carrying. The drug was in two sachets. Preliminary field tests carried out in his presence tested positive to meth.

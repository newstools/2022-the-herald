The Herald PARIS. — Like Olympique Lyonnais, Tino Kadewere is coming out of a complicated season. He was recruited for e12 million  in Le Havre, during the 2020 winter transfer window, although the centre forward ended the 2019-2020 financial year with the HAC, before joining Les Gones the following summer. The Zimbabwean’s adventure with Lyon had started well, directly involved, with 13 goals for his team. However, he did not manage to confirm his good performances the following season, in particular because of an injury which occurred during the first days. The centre-forward still has two years of contract with Lyon. At the end of his first successful exercise, Kadewere’s rating on the market has more than doubled, going from e6.5 million after a few months of competition, to e14 million. Having played just 20 games in all competitions in 2021-2022, including very few as a starter, the value of number 11 has plummeted, as he is now worth e6 million, according to Transfermarkt. The observation is similar for the Football Observatory (CIES), which values the player under contract until June 2024 between e4 million and e7 million. At 26 and two years from the end of his lease, the Zimbabwean international is in a special situation. In addition to failing to establish himself as an essential element of the Lyon workforce, he must also deal with the return to the fold of the top scorer in the history of the club. In a recent interview with The Herald in Zimbabwe, Kadewere clarified that he was not worried about his future, and that he would know more after his meeting with the leaders of Lyon. — Sportune.

The Herald ORLANDO. — Mikel Arteta insists he will continue to try to bolster his Arsenal squad until the end of the transfer window but has remained tight-lipped over the club’s move for Manchester City star Oleksandr Zinchenko. Arsenal have signed Brazilian duo Marquinhos and Gabriel Jesus, American goalkeeper Matt Turner and Portuguese midfielder Fabio Vieira so far this summer. But Arteta is keen to strengthen his squad further while the transfer market remains open, with Arsenal closing in on a £30m deal for Man City’s Zinchenko. Asked about Arsenal’s transfer window so far and his plans for the next few weeks, Arteta said: ‘’We’ve been trying to (sign players earlier) and we have two recruitments already. ‘’Until the end of the market we will keep trying to improve the squad and there are so many parties involved and sometimes things are not as quick as you want.’’ Pressed for an update on Arsenal’s pursuit of Zinchenko, Arteta added: ‘’There is no update with anybody and when there are updates we will let you know. ‘’We’re looking at different options in different positions and we’ll give you an update when we have it.’’ But Arsenal have reached an agreement with Zinchenko over personal terms, reports David Ornstein. It will see the 25-year-old join the club on a four-year deal as the side’s fifth signing of the summer window. The Ukraine international will leave Manchester City’s pre-season tour to have a medical with the north London club before signing with his new side. Arsenal and Manchester City have set a deadline of the end of the week to get a deal across the line for Zinchenko, according to Fabrizio Romano. A fee has been agreed for the transfer, but there remains the hurdle of personal terms. — Metro

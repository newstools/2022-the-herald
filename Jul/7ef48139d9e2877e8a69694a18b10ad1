MIGHTY Warriors’ Herentals Queens goalkeeper Lindiwe Magwede was the star of the show as her team finally worked out a formula that pinned down Black Rhinos in a Women’s Super League football match at 2 Brigade on Saturday. Praynence Zvawanda scored the solitary goal that made sure the Students beat the army side in the league for the first time since their promotion into the top-flight in 2017. The victory helped the Stephen Mudawapi-coached charges to consolidate their lead at the top of the standings with 37 points from 13 matches. Black Rhinos Queens remained third with 30 points but they have played two games less than the leaders. Mudawapi hailed his charges after the win. “I am very happy for the girls. They did so well to help us win our first match against Black Rhinos Queens since our promotion into the top league in 2017. I think the best result we got against them was a goalless draw in 2019,” said Mudawapi. “But we are not getting carried away by this result. We will take each game as it comes ensuring that we retain the maximum focus.” Elsewhere, second-placed Chapungu Queens (33 points) beat Harare City 3-0 at Rufaro with Fellistars Muchekenya, Ethel Chinyerere and Dorothy Nyoni getting the goals for the Air Force of Zimbabwe side. At Nyamauru in Mutare, Chipembere Queens beat Faith Drive 3-0 while Borrow Jets were  2-0  victors over Conduit Soccer Academy at Hillside Centre in Bulawayo. Scorpion Queens beat hapless Black Mambas Queens 8-0 at Pfupajena Stadium with Tafadzwa Tsunguro grabbing a quartet of goals while Belinda Sibanda, Lisa Tapiringana, Belinda Veremu and Divine Makusha grabbed a goal each.

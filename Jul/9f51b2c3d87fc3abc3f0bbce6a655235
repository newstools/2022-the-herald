The Herald PROMISING Zimbabwean professional golfer Stuart Krog secured his first top ten finish of the season on the Altron Big Easy Tour this season when he finished in a tie for ninth place at Houghton Golf Club in Johannesburg, South Africa, on Thursday. The 24-year-old, who has been gaining some valuable experience on the South African developmental tour, carded a final round of two-under-par-70. His final round which featured three birdies and two bogeys left him on one-under-par 215 for the tournament and tied for ninth position with South Korea’s DK Kim. Krog initially got his campaign off to a difficult start after carding a 73 in the first round but bounced back with solid rounds of 72 and 70. In fact, Krog’s week could have been a lot back had it not been for a triple-bogey seven on the 18th during the second round which denied him a round in the 60s. However, it was still a fruitful week for the talented Zimbabwean as he continues to work his way up on the professional ranks in the future. Krog, who missed the cut in the previous Altron Big Easy Tour event at Randpark Golf Club, was delighted to bounce back with a top 10 finish and expressed his satisfaction on his Instagram page. He wrote: “Top 10 this week at Houghton Golf Club always a good week on the Big Easy Tour. Congrats to my man @r1ckelous (Ricky Hendler) on the win, much deserved. On to the next week!!” Krog finished just five shots behind South African Ricky Hendler, who finally got his breakthrough win on the Altron Big Easy Tour after his final-round 70 earned him a one-shot victory over Reinhardt Blaauw at Houghton Golf Club on Thursday. The Big Easy Tour was founded in 2011 with support from Ernie Els and counts current international star Christiaan Bezuidenhout among its former Order of Merit winners. – ZimSportLive
